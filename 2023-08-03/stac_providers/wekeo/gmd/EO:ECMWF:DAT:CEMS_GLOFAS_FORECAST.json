  "description": "This dataset contains global modelled daily data of river discharge forced with meteorological forecasts. The data was produced by the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), which is part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). River discharge, or river flow as it is also known, is defined as the amount of water that flows through a river section at a given time. \nThis dataset is simulated by forcing a hydrological modelling chain with input from ECMWF ensemble forecast combined with the ECMWF extended-range ensemble forecast up to 30 days. Data availability for the GloFAS forecast is from 2019-11-05 up to near real time.\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nRiver discharge in the last 24 hours\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nUpstream area",
