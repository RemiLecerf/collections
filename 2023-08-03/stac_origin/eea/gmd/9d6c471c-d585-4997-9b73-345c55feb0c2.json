  "description": "EU-Hydro is a dataset for all EEA38 countries and United Kingdom providing photo-interpreted river network, consistent of surface interpretation of water bodies (lakes and wide rivers), and a drainage model (also called Drainage Network), derived from EU-DEM, with catchments and drainage lines and nodes. \nThis metadata refers to the EU-Hydro coastline, which is disseminated as one shapefile merged for all 35 basins. The coastline is also included for each basin in the EU-Hydro River Network Database. \nThe production of EU-Hydro and the derived layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.",
