  "description": "The European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) is a component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. EGMS provides consistent, regular, standardised, harmonised and reliable information regarding natural and anthropogenic ground motion phenomena over the Copernicus Participating States and across national borders, with millimetre accuracy. This set of metadata describes the second product level of EGMS: Calibrated. \n\nThis product is considered the main EGMS product as it serves the needs of most users. It contains the same type of information as the Basic product (https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/1aeea29f-cea2-4494-af80-789a038a87b8), but the measurement points are referenced to a model derived from global navigation satellite system data. Thus, the measurements are not relative anymore and are considered as absolute. The calibrated product makes it possible to compare ground motion measurements from adjacent areas belonging to different products of the same level.\n\nEGMS Calibrated is visualised as a vector map of measurement points, colour-coded by average velocity, and distributed to users in comma-separated values format. Each point is associated with a time series of displacement, i.e. a plot with values of displacement per acquisition of the satellite. The product is generated for both ascending and descending orbits.",
