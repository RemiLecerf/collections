  "description": "The Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S3) NRT AOD product quantifies the abundance of aerosol particles, and monitors their global distribution & long-range transport, at the scale of 9.5 x 9.5 km2. All observations are made available in less than 3 hours from the SLSTR observation sensing time. It is only applicable during daytime. \nThe current S3 NRT AOD product is the first release as Baseline Collection 1. \nUsers are advised to bear in mind the different maturity statuses between ocean and land surfaces where:\n• AOD Ocean is pre-operational \n• AOD Land is currently demonstrational\nFurther improvements to the S3 NRT AOD product are planned, including the optimization of the spectral constraints over land continents in case of unfavourable dual-view geometry, a comprehensive global validation, and additional updates following feedback from selected Sentinel-3 NRT atmosphere experts.",
