  "description": "This is a reprocessed dataset at baseline F08, which is continued by the NTC data stream from 09/Feb/2023 onwards.\n\nThe Level-1A product contains Level 1 intermediate output of the HR processor (RAW and RMC). It includes geo-located bursts of Ku echoes (at ~9 kHz) with all instrument calibrations applied. It includes the full rate complex waveforms input to the delay/Doppler or SAR processor.\n\nThis product is most relevant to altimetry specialists, working on fundamental SAR processing techniques and calibration studies.\n\nSentinel-6 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme. It is a collaborative Copernicus mission, implemented and co-funded by the European Commission, ESA, EUMETSAT and the USA, through NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
