    "description": "ArcticDEM is a digital surface model (DSM) that portrays first-return\nelevation values that include vegetation, tree canopy, buildings, and other\nman-made surface features. The 2m asset is a collection of strips rather\nthan a single mosaic due to projection differences between strips.\n\nStrip DEM files correspond to the overlapping area of the input stereopair\nimage swaths as they are collected by DigitalGlobe's constellation of\npolar-orbiting satellites. Strip DEM dimensions will vary according to the\nsatellite sensor that acquired the images and the off-nadir angle of\ncollection. Most strips are between 16km and 18km in width, and 110km and\n120km in length.\n",
