  "description": "Snow cover is highly sensitive to changes in temperature (freezing/thaw) and precipitation (snowfall, rain, hail) and affects directly the albedo and thus the energy balance of the Earthâ€™s surface. It is a relevant input parameter for weather forecasts and climate change observations. Snow stores a significant mass of water and, with its high dynamic, has a strong effect on regional and global energy and water cycles. Together with the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) product from passive microwave sensors, that provides information on the water content in the snow on plain areas, up-to-date knowledge about the snow cover extent is an important information for hydrological runoff modelling and for assessing natural hazards such as flood events.\n\nSnow cover is specified as Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).",
