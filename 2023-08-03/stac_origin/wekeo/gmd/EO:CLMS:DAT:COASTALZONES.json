  "description": "Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) classification as part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Local Component, tailored to the needs of monitoring of an important region for European economy such us the coastal area. The map covers a buffer zone of coastline derived from EU-Hydro. LC/LU is extracted from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite data and other available data. The reference years for the classification is 2012 and 2018. The class definitions follow the pre-defined nomenclature on the basis of Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) typology of ecosystems (Level 1 to Level 4) and CORINE Land Cover adapted to the specific characteristics of coastal zones. The classification provides 71 distinct thematic classes with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha and a Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of 10 m. The product is available for the 2012 and 2018 reference year including change mapping (2012 - 2018).\n\nFor further information on the CLMS Local Component please refer to https://land.copernicus.eu/local.",
