  "description": "This dataset provides in situ and remote sensing derived glacier changes from individual glaciers globally. The dataset represents the latest homogenized state-of-the-art\n\t\t\tglacier change data collected by scientists and the national correspondents of each country as provided to the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). The product is an extract \n\t\t\tof the WGMS Fluctuations of Glacier (FoG) database and consists of two data sets providing time series of glacier changes: \n\t\t\tglacier elevation change series from the geodetic method and glacier mass-balance series from the glaciological method",
