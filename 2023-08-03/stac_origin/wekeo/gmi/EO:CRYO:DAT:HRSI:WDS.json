  "description": "The Wet/Dry Snow (WDS) product is generated in near real-time for the entire EEA39 domain based on C-band SAR satellite data from the Sentinel-1 constellation (revisit time: 6 days with Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) within the fractional snow cover on top of canopy (FSCTOC) derived from overlapping optical satellite data from the Sentinel-2 constellation (revisit time: 5 days with Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B). The product provides the snow state condition (wet / dry) for surfaces covered by snow (FSCTOC >= 90%) for non-forested land areas with a spatial resolution of 60 m x 60 m. Urban areas, forest and water bodies as well as clouds and cloud shadows from the S2 based FSCTOC product of the same date are masked.",
