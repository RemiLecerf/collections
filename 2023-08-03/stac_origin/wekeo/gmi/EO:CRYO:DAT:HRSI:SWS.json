  "description": "The SAR Wet Snow (SWS) product is generated in near real-time for selected high mountain areas of the EEA39 domain based on C-band SAR satellite data from the Sentinel-1 constellation (revisit time: 6 days with Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B). The product provides the wet snow extent for high mountain areas with a spatial resolution of 60 m x 60 m. Dry snow cannot be discriminated from patchy snow or snow free areas by the means of C-band SAR data only and are thus combined in one class. Radar shadow / layover / foreshortening, water bodies, forests, urban areas, and non-mountain regions are masked.",
