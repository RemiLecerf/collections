      <dct:abstract xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">This dataset provides gridded modelled daily hydrological time series forced with seasonal meteorological forecasts. The dataset is a consistent representation of the most important hydrological variables across the European Flood Awareness (EFAS) domain. The temporal resolution is daily forecasts initialised once a month consisting of:

River discharge
Soil moisture for three soil layers
Snow water equivalent

It also provides static data on soil depth for the three soil layers. Soil moisture and river discharge data are accompanied by ancillary files for interpretation (see related variables and links in the documentation).
This dataset was produced by forcing the LISFLOOD hydrological model at a 5x5km resolution with seasonal meteorological ensemble forecasts. The forecasts are initialised on the first of each month with a lead time of 215 days at 24-hour time steps. The meteorological data are seasonal forecasts (SEAS5) from the European Centre of Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 51 ensemble members. The forecasts are available from November 2020.
Companion datasets, also available through the Climate Data Store (CDS), are seasonal reforecasts for research, local skill assessment and post-processing of the seasonal forecasts. There are also medium-range forecasts for users who want to look at shorter time ranges. These are accompanied by historical simulations which can be used to derive the hydrological climatology, and medium-range reforecasts. For users looking for global hydrological data, we refer to the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) forecasts and historical simulations. All these datasets are part of the operational flood forecasting within the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).

Variables in the dataset/application are:
River discharge in the last 24 hours, Snow depth water equivalent, Soil depth, Volumetric soil moisture

Variables in the dataset/application are:
Orography, Upstream area</dct:abstract>
