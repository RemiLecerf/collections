      <dct:abstract xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">The dataset provides bioclimatic indicators derived from CMIP5 climate projections at 1 km x 1 km resolution for selected regions; Europe, Northern Brazil and Central Africa. This comprehensive set of bioclimatic indicators is specifically relevant for applications within the biodiversity and ecosystem services community.
The 76 indicators cover bioclimatic variables for the land environment, characterising surface energy, drought, soil moisture and the (near-) surface climate including wind as well as Essential Climate Variables (ECV). The selection of indicators is based upon user requirements and consultation with stakeholders in order to facilitate the direct use of climate information in screening analyses or in diverse downstream applications.
The indicators are calculated based on daily CMIP5 climate projections from 10 Global Circulation Models for two future climate scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 &amp; RCP 8.5. The indicators have been downscaled to 1 x 1 km resolution using a statistical downscaling methodology that takes into account the relationship between orography and a climate state variable. The data have been additionally bias-adjusted against ERA5 reanalysis data.
This dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.
