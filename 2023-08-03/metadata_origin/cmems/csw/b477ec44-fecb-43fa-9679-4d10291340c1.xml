      <dct:abstract>'''DEFINITION'''

The OMI_EXTREME_WAVE_IBI_swh_mean_and_anomaly_obs indicator is based on the computation of the 99th and the 1st percentiles from in situ data (observations). It is computed for the variable significant wave height (swh) measured by in situ buoys. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P&#233;rez G&#243;mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P&#233;rez G&#243;mez et al 2018). 

'''CONTEXT'''

Projections on Climate Change foresee a future with a greater frequency of extreme sea states (Stott, 2016; Mitchell, 2006). The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010).

'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS'''

The mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a wide range from 2-3m in the Canary Island with 0.1-0.3 m of standard deviation (std), 3.5m in the Gulf of Cadiz with 0.5m of std, 4-6m in the English Channel 0.5-0.6m of std, 4-7m in the Bay of Biscay with 0.4-0.9m of std to 8m in the West of the British Isles with 0.7m of std. 
Results for this year show slight negative anomalies in the Canary Island (-0.1/-0.17m), moderate negative anomaly in the Gulf of Cadiz (-0.7m) and general positive anomaly in the rest of the area, with moderate values in the Bay of Biscay (+0.16/+1.1) and the English Channel (-0.6/+0.8m) and an appreciable positive value in the West of the British Isles over the standard deviation (+1.5m).  Severe storms developed in the Atlantic during 2020 reached the West of the British Isles and the Bay of Biscay, like Storm Brendan in January, Storm Dennis in February or Storms Ernesto and Bella in December. These storms produced waves with significant wave height over 9 m recorded by the buoys in the area.
