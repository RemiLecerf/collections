      <dct:abstract>'''DEFINITION'''

Estimates of Arctic liquid Freshwater Content (FWC in meters) are obtained from integrated differences of the measured salinity and a reference salinity (set to 34.8) from the surface to the bottom per unit area in the Arctic region with a water depth greater than 500m as function of salinity (S), the vertical cell thickness of the dataset (dz) and the salinity reference (Sref). Waters saltier than the 34.8 reference are not included in the estimation. The regional FWC values from 1993 up to real time are then averaged aiming to:
* obtain the mean FWC as expressed in cubic km (km3) 
* monitor the large-scale variability and change of liquid freshwater stored in the Arctic Ocean (i.e. the change of FWC in time).

'''CONTEXT'''

The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the global mean and its climate is undergoing unprecedented and drastic changes, affecting all the components of the Arctic system. Many of these changes affect the hydrological cycle. Monitoring the storage of freshwater in the Arctic region is essential for understanding the contemporary Earth system state and variability. Variations in Arctic freshwater can induce changes in ocean stratification. Exported southward downstream, these waters have potential future implications for global circulation and heat transport.  

'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS'''

Since 1993, the Arctic Ocean freshwater has experienced a significant increase of 423 &#177; 39 km3/year. The year 2016 witnessed the highest freshwater content in the Artic since the last 24 years. Second half of 2016 and first half of 2017 show a substantial decrease of the FW storage. 

Note: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.
