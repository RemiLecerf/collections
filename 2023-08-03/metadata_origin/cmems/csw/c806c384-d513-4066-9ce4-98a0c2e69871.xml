      <dct:abstract>'''DEFINITION'''

The BALTIC_OMI_TEMPSAL_sst_area_averaged_anomalies product includes time series of monthly mean SST anomalies over the period 1993-2021, relative to the 1993-2014 climatology, averaged for the Baltic Sea. 
The OMI time series runs from Jan 1, 1993 to December 31, 2021 and is constructed by calculating monthly averages from the daily level 4 SST analysis fields of the SST_BAL_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_016 product from 1993 to 2021. See the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018) for more information on the OMI product. 

'''CONTEXT'''

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is an Essential Climate Variable (GCOS), that is an important input for initialis-ing numerical weather prediction models and fundamental for understanding air-sea interactions and moni-toring climate change (GCOS 2010). The Baltic Sea is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST records and the assessment of climatic variability (H&#248;yer and She 2007; H&#248;yer and Karagali 2016). The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed basin affected bynatural variability,  influenced by large-scale atmos-pheric processes and by the vicinity of land. In addition, the Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish seas in the world. When analysing regional-scale climate variability, all these effects have to be considered, which re-quires dedicated regional and validated SST products. Satellite observations have previously been used to ana-lyse the climatic SST signals in the North Sea and Baltic Sea (BACC II Author Team 2015; Lehmann et al. 2011). Recently, H&#248;yer and Karagali (2016) demonstrated that the Baltic Sea had warmed 1-2 oC from 1982 to 2012 considering all months of the year and 3-5 oC when only July-September months were considered. This was corroborated in the Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016 and section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018). 

'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS'''

The basin-average trend of SST anomalies for Baltic Sea region amounts to 0.049&#177;0.006 &#176;C/year over the pe-riod 1993-2021 which corresponds to an average warming of 1.42&#176;C. Adding the North Sea area, the average trend amounts to 0.03&#177;0.003 &#176;C/year over the same period, which corresponds to an average warming of 0.87&#176;C for the entire region since 1993.
