      <dct:abstract>'''DEFINITION'''

Ocean heat content (OHC) is defined here as the deviation from a reference period (1993-2014) and is closely proportional to the average temperature change from z1 = 0 m to z2 = 700 m depth:
OHC=&#8747;_(z_1)^(z_2)&#961;_0  c_p (T_yr-T_clim )dz 								[1]
with a reference density of = 1030 kgm-3 and a specific heat capacity of cp = 3980 J kg-1 &#176;C-1 (e.g. von Schuckmann et al., 2009).
Time series of annual mean values area averaged ocean heat content is provided for the Mediterranean Sea (30&#176;N, 46&#176;N; 6&#176;W, 36&#176;E) and is evaluated for topography deeper than 300m.

'''CONTEXT'''

Knowing how much and where heat energy is stored and released in the ocean is essential for understanding the contemporary Earth system state, variability and change, as the oceans shape our perspectives for the future.
The quality evaluation of MEDSEA_OMI_OHC_area_averaged_anomalies is based on the &#8220;multi-product&#8221; approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (von Schuckmann et al., 2018), and following the MyOcean&#8217;s experience (Masina et al., 2017). 
Six global products and a regional (Mediterranean Sea) product have been used to build an ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread. The reference products are:
	The Mediterranean Sea Reanalysis at 1/24 degree horizontal resolution (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004, DOI: https://doi.org/10.25423/CMCC/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004_E3R1, Escudier et al., 2020)
	Four global reanalyses at 1/4 degree horizontal resolution (GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_031): 
GLORYS, C-GLORS, ORAS5, FOAM
	Two observation based products: 
CORA (INSITU_GLO_TS_REP_OBSERVATIONS_013_001_b) and 
ARMOR3D (MULTIOBS_GLO_PHY_TSUV_3D_MYNRT_015_012). 
Details on the products are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI. 

'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS'''

The ensemble mean ocean heat content anomaly time series over the Mediterranean Sea shows a continuous increase in the period 1993-2019 at rate of 1.4&#177;0.3 W/m2 in the upper 700m. After 2005 the rate has clearly increased with respect the previous decade, in agreement with Iona et al. (2018).
