      <dct:abstract>Fraction of vegetation Cover (FCOVER) corresponds to the gap fraction for nadir direction. It is used to separate vegetation and soil in energy balance processes, including temperature and evapotranspiration. It is computed from the leaf area index and other canopy structural variables and does not depend on variables such as the geometry of illumination as compared to FAPAR. For this reason, it is a very good candidate for the replacement of classical vegetation indices for the monitoring of green vegetation. Because of the linear relationship with radiometric signal, FCOVER will be only marginally scale dependent. Note that similarly to LAI and FAPAR, only the green elements will be considered, either belonging both to the overstorey and understorey.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The input data are the daily Top of the Atmosphere reflectances measured by the PROBA-VEGETATION sensor. They are calibrated, the clouds and their shadows are removed, and they are atmospherically-corrected to get the Top Of the Canopy reflectances. The existing CYCLOPES V3.1 FCOVER product is scaled to correct a significant underestimation. Then, it is used to calibrate a neural network over the BELMANIP2 set of sites to relate the FCOVER to the corresponding atmospherically-corrected and directionally-normalized top of canopy reflectances.</dc:source>
