      <dct:abstract>Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the radiative skin temperature over land. LST plays an important role in the physics of land surface as it is involved in the processes of energy and water exchange with the atmosphere. LST is useful for the scientific community, namely for those dealing with meteorological and climate models. Accurate values of LST are also of special interest in a wide range of areas related to land surface processes, including meteorology, hydrology, agrometeorology, climatology and environmental studies.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The objective of the LST product is to increase the area coverage of the LST product currently distributed by the Eumetsat Satellite Application Facility (SAF) on Land Surface Analysis (LSA). The LSA SAF generates, archives and disseminates LST from SEVIRI (onboard MSG) with a 15-minute frequency, at the original satellite spatial resolution. A near global product is obtained by merging SEVIRI- with GOES- and HIMAWARI-based LST produced with an hourly frequency. For more detailed information consult the Product User Manual.</dc:source>
