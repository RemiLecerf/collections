The dataset has been produced using the marine ecosystem model, ERSEM v15.06 (European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model), coupled to the regional ocean circulation models, POLCOMS (the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System) and NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) using the FABM (Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models) coupler. ERSEM is designed to simulate the cycles of carbon and the major nutrient elements nitrogen, phosphorous and silicon within the marine environment. Organisms at the base of the marine food web \u2013 the microscopic aquatic plants known as phytoplankton \u2013 play an integral role in these cycles and are explicitly represented in the model. So are the microscopic marine organisms which feed upon them and provide a vital link to commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish higher up the food chain.</p>\n<p>POLCOMS and NEMO are well-established physical models with the ability to simulate regions that include both the deep ocean and the continental shelf. They track the movement of water and transfer of energy and momentum in three dimensions, enabling the water temperature, salinity (the salt content of sea water) and currents to be modelled. The coupled POLCOMS/NEMO-ERSEM system makes it possible to include the effects of physical transport and mixing processes on the spatiotemporal distribution of nutrients, phytoplankton, and other components of the marine ecosystem. The dataset includes physical variables, such as horizontal velocity components, temperature and salinity; and a range of biogeochemical variables, including the concentration of dissolved oxygen and the concentration of different nutrients. These variables were simulated under two future scenarios, based on different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) for future greenhouse gas emissions: the intermediate scenario, RCP4.5, in which greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 before declining; and the business as usual scenario, RCP8.5, in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the century. The hydrodynamic biogeochemical models were each driven by a global climate model generated for the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) at the open ocean boundaries, in combination with downscaled atmospheric data generated using the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric Model (RCA4).</p>\n<p>This dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. </p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td><p>POLCOMS-ERSEM: Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea (20W to 37E, 11N to 65N)</p>\n<p>NEMO-ERSEM: Northwest European Shelf (20W to 13E, 40N to 65N)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td><p>POLCOMS-ERSEM: 0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0 (approx. 11km)</p>\n<p>NEMO-ERSEM: 0.06\u00b0 x 0.06\u00b0 (approx. 7km)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td>0-5500 m below sea level</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td><p>POLCOMS-ERSEM: 43 vertical levels</p>\n<p>NEMO-ERSEM: 43 vertical levels</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td><p>POLCOMS-ERSEM: 2006 up to 2100</p>\n<p>NEMO-ERSEM: 2006 up to 2050</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Daily and/or monthly.

Such differences typically occur when biological activity acts to change the ambient concentration of oxygen. For example, molecular oxygen is produced during photosynthesis, which increases its concentration, while oxygen is consumed during respiration which decreases its concentration. The AOU represents the sum of the biological activity that a sample has experienced since it was last in equilibrium with the atmosphere. It is a 4D field (time, location, depth) which has the same units as dissolved oxygen. In shallow waters, the full water column is generally in close contact with the atmosphere and AOU values are low, since oxygen is close to its saturation concentration. However, in deeper waters that are relatively isolated from the atmosphere, large AOU values are possible.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Euphotic zone chlorophyll-a</td><td class='variables-units'>kg m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>This is a 4D field (time, location, depth), from which the surface chlorophyll-a field is calculated by taking the average concentration over one optical depth. Here, optical depth is taken to be the depth at which downwelling irradiance has been reduced to 1% of that at the surface \u2013 a level that is often used to define the base of the euphotic zone. Note this measure of optical depth is different to the e-folding length scale which is commonly used in satellite applications, for example.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Euphotic zone depth</td><td class='variables-units'>m</td><td class='variables-description'>Euphotic zone depth is taken to be the depth at which downwelling irradiance has been reduced to 1% of that at the surface \u2013 a level that is often used to define the base of the euphotic zone. Note this measure of optical depth is different to the e-folding length scale which is commonly used in satellite applications.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Mole concentration of dissolved oxygen</td><td class='variables-units'>mol m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>The presence of oxygen is an essential pre-requisite for all forms of complex marine life, including commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish.  Its concentration is influenced by multiple processes, including air-sea gas exchange, production through oxygenic photosynthesis and consumption via respiration. Surface oxygen concentrations are strongly influenced by air-sea gas exchange, and oxygen is generally in plentiful supply in surface ocean waters. However, in deeper waters oxygen may become depleted due to the activity of bacteria and other organisms that consume oxygen during respiration; if the rate of consumption exceeds the rate of supply, then oxygen levels will fall. Oxygen concentrations above 190 mmol m-3 are considered to be sufficient to support healthy marine communities with minimal problems, while oxygen concentrations below 62.5 mmol m-3 are considered to be a source of serious concern. The concentration of dissolved molecular oxygen is a 4D field (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the coupled model.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Mole concentration of nitrate and nitrite</td><td class='variables-units'>mol  m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Both nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) are taken up from sea water by marine phytoplankton, which incorporate the nitrogen into new biomass as they grow. Nitrogen is an essential element for phytoplankton, and the amount available strongly influences their potential for growth. In the model, nitrate and nitrite are represented by a single state variable. The concentration field is 4D (time, location, depth). Across much of the model domain, there are large seasonal variations in the near surface concentration of nitrate and nitrite: during the spring, phytoplankton draw the concentration down as they grow; concentrations can remain low for much of the summer, before being replenished via mixing with deeper, nutrient rich waters during the winter months. Several other factors influence the concentration of nitrate and nitrite, include inputs from rivers, atmospheric deposition, and various biological processes involved in the break down or organic material by marine bacteria.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Mole concentration of phosphate</td><td class='variables-units'>mol m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>The mole concentration of phosphate in sea water. Phosphate (PO43-) is taken up from sea water by marine phytoplankton which incorporate the phosphorous into new biomass as they grow. Phosphorous is an essential element for phytoplankton, and the amount available strongly influences their potential for growth. The phosphate concentration field is 4D (time, location, depth). Across much of the model domain, there are large seasonal variations in the near surface concentration of phosphate: during the spring, phytoplankton draw the concentration down as they grow; concentrations can remain low for much of the summer, before being replenished via mixing with deeper, nutrient rich waters during the winter months.

Diatoms are a major group of phytoplankton that utilize silicic acid \u2013 the primary form of silicate in sea water \u2013 to build their cell wall. Diatoms often dominate the phytoplankton community and are major contributors to marine primary production. They also play a disproportionately important role in carbon export \u2013 the process by which carbon is transferred to the deep ocean from productive near surface waters \u2013 which in turn impacts the long-term ability of the ocean to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Their potential to become limited by the concentration of silicate in sea water has motivated the explicit inclusion of silicate in many marine biogeochemical models, including ERSEM. The silicate concentration field is 4D (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the coupled model.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Net primary production</td><td class='variables-units'>mol m<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Net primary production is the excess of gross primary production (rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (\u201cproducers\u201d, which is this case are photosynthetic phytoplankton), over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. In the oceans, carbon production per unit volume is often found at a number of depths at a given horizontal location. That quantity can then be integrated to calculate production per unit area at the location. Here, it is a 4D field (time, location, depth) that is made up of contributions from the four different phytoplankton groups included in ERSEM. Net primary production is a critical measure of marine ecosystem function, since it represents the amount of carbon and energy that is available to organisms higher up the food chain. The area covered by the model domain is characterized by large spatial and seasonal variations in net primary production, which reflect differences in environmental conditions (e.g. the availability of light and nutrients).</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Organic carbon in the water column</td><td class='variables-units'>mol  m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>The mole concentration of non-living organic carbon in sea water. The total amount of non-living organic carbon is made up of dissolved and particulate components. The dissolved component includes unstable carbon rich compounds (e.g. sugars) which may have been secreted by phytoplankton cells, and more refractory forms which can persist in the oceans for many years. The particulate forms include contributions from dead cells and zooplankton faecal pellets.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Phytoplankton carbon</td><td class='variables-units'>mol m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>The mole concentration of phytoplankton carbon in sea water. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. The mole concentration of phytoplankton carbon corresponds to the amount of carbon contained within the molecules that make up phytoplankton cells. In ERSEM, the total amount of phytoplankton carbon is made up of contributions from the four different phytoplankton groups: diatoms, and three groups that are primarily distinguished by their size, which are the pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton. The classification reflects a choice made within the model regarding how to represent the multitude of different phytoplankton taxa that can be found in the ocean. The mole concentration of phytoplankton carbon is a 4D field (time, location, depth), which exhibits large spatial and temporal variations across the model domain</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Potential energy anomaly</td><td class='variables-units'>J m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Stratification indices describe the extent to which vertical mixing between bodies of water with distinct physical properties is suppressed. The potential energy anomaly is a quantitative measure of stratification that represents the work required to bring about complete mixing of a column of water. It is a 3D field (time, location). The higher the potential anomaly, the more stratified the water column. A potential energy anomaly of zero is indicative of a fully mixed water column. Temperate shelf seas are often seasonally stratified, with vertical mixing suppressed from the spring through to the autumn.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Saturation state of aragonite</td><td class='variables-units'>Dimensionless</td><td class='variables-description'>Aragonite is one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate. It is widely used by calcifying marine organisms, including corals and certain types of phytoplankton, to build physical structures. The saturation state of aragonite is dependent on the seawater chemistry of calcium and carbonate ions. When the saturation state of seawater is greater than one, it is said to be supersaturated with respect to aragonite, making it possible for marine organisms to generate physical structures made from aragonite. When the saturation state is less than one, the seawater is said to be under-saturated with respect to aragonite, meaning the aragonite mineral tends to dissolve in seawater. When carbon dioxide is added to the sea from the atmosphere the pH tends to fall, which in turn acts to reduce the saturation state of seawater with respect to aragonite. For this reason, the saturation state of aragonite is widely used to track ocean acidification. The aragonite saturation state is a 4D field (time, location, depth) and is calculated by ERSEM.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Sea water pH</td><td class='variables-units'>Dimensionless</td><td class='variables-description'>pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. The more hydrogen ions that are present, the more acidic is the solution. The pH scale ranges from zero (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). A pH of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Today, ocean water is normally slightly basic, with a surface-water pH of about 8.1. pH is measured on a logarithmic scale, meaning a single unit corresponds to a ten-fold difference. Ocean pH is a 4D field (time, location, depth) and is calculated by ERSEM. It is a function of several other variables, including the amount of inorganic carbon in sea water; the pH of sea water falls (i.e. it becomes more acidic) as more carbon dioxide is taken up from the atmosphere by the ocean. Changes in ocean pH can directly impact many marine organisms, including certain types of phytoplankton.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Sea water potential temperature</td><td class='variables-units'>K</td><td class='variables-description'>The temperature a parcel of sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure. The potential temperature field is 4D (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the physical circulation model. The area covered by the model domain is characterized by large latitudinal and seasonal variations in surface temperature, with the lowest surface temperatures found in the northern reaches of the domain, where typical values are a few degrees above zero in winter. In contrast, in the southern reaches of the domain, surface temperatures can exceed 25 deg. C in the summer. Away from the surface, and especially in deeper waters off the continental shelf, temperatures are generally more stable with a typical value being a few degrees above zero. The temperature of sea water influences ocean currents and mixing. It also influences many biological processes, and species are generally adapted to a specific range of temperatures.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Sea water salinity</td><td class='variables-units'>PSU</td><td class='variables-description'>The salt content of sea water as measured on the practical salinity scale. The sea water practical salinity field is 4D (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the physical circulation model. Within the model domain, low salinity values can be found near to sources of freshwater such as river mouths. The Mediterranean Sea is characterized by relatively high salinity values, which may approach 40 PSU (practical salinity units). The salinity of sea water influences ocean currents and mixing.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Secondary production</td><td class='variables-units'>mol m<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Secondary production is the difference between the organic carbon consumed by zooplankton and zooplankton respiration which produces inorganic carbon. It is a 4D field (time, location, depth) and is made up of contributions from the three different zooplankton groups included in ERSEM. Secondary production is a key measure of marine ecosystem function, in part because it determines the amount of carbon and energy available to commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish higher up the food chain. The area covered by the model domain is characterized by large spatial and seasonal variations in net primary production, which reflect differences in food availability and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, which controls key metabolic rates)</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Total chlorophyll-a</td><td class='variables-units'>kg m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. In the ocean, chlorophyll-a is commonly used as an index for phytoplankton abundance. However, the relationship is not direct, in part due to a process called photoadaptation, in which cells down-regulate the synthesis of pigments in high light environments. A model of photoadaptation is included in ERSEM, meaning the intracellular ratio of phytoplankton Chlorophyll-a to carbon can change in response to changes in simulated environmental conditions. In ERSEM, the dynamics of four different phytoplankton groups are modelled. Each group independently regulates its concentration of chlorophyll-a, which is used to calculate photosynthetic rates. The total chlorophyll-a field is the sum of the contribution from the four different groups.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Zooplankton carbon</td><td class='variables-units'>mol m<sup>-3</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Zooplankton are heterotrophic organisms that feed on both living and non-living organic matter within the water column. The mole concentration of zooplankton carbon corresponds to the amount of carbon contained within the molecules that make up their bodies. In ERSEM, the total amount of zooplankton carbon is made up of contributions from three different zooplankton groups that are primarily distinguished by their size: heterotrophic nanoflagellates, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton. The classification reflects a choice made within the model regarding how to represent the multitude of different zooplankton taxa that can be found in the ocean. The mole concentration of zooplankton carbon is a 4D field (time, location, depth), which exhibits large spatial and temporal variations across the model domain.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>u-velocity component</td><td class='variables-units'>m s<sup>-1</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Eastward horizontal surface velocity of a water parcel, as calculated by the physical circulation model. The horizontal surface velocity is a vector quantity, which is broken up into Northward and Eastward components. \u201cEastward\u201d indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Several factors can influence the horizontal velocity field, and thus drive ocean currents. Across the continental shelf, and especially in near shore environments, the effect of tides is often evident and can drive ocean currents with speeds well in-excess of 1 m s<sup>-1.</sup> Due to the period of tides, the velocity components are computed as 25 hour mean value</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>v-velocity component</td><td class='variables-units'>m s<sup>-1</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>Northward horizontal surface velocity of a water parcel, as calculated by the physical circulation model.
