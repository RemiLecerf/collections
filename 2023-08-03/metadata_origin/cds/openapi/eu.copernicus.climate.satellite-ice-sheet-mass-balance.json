The GRACE twin satellites measured changes in the Earth\u2019s gravitational field over time and inferred from them mass changes over the ice sheets, using the regional integration approach. A timeseries of mass change is provided for each ice sheet, and also for each drainage basin separately.</p>\n<p>The dataset complements ice change measurements made by other methods, such as the surface elevation change rate detailed in the Climate Data Store (CDS) dataset: 'Ice sheet surface elevation change rate for Greenland and Antarctica from 1992 to present from derived satellite observations', which covers the same areas and includes the GRACE mission timespan.</p>\n<p>The data was brokered from ESA\u2019s Greenland and ESA's Antarctic Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiative projects.</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Time series</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Average over  the Antarctic and Greenland regions including the major drainage basins</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>One time series per basin</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td>Surface</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td>Single level</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>From 2003 to 2020</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Monthly</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF-4</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Versions</th><td>3.0 (for the period from 2003 to 2017 the data correspondes to the previous version 2.0)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>Annually</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n            <tr><td colspan=\"3\">The names of the variables in the netCDF files differ from the names used in this Catalogue entry.
