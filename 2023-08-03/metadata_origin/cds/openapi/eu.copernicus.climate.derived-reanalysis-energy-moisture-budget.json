In addition, the divergences of the lateral fluxes are provided. </p>\n<p>These divergences and  fluxes are also available in the ERA5 archive, but do not employ mass-consistent horizontal wind fields and are contaminated with numerical noise. In the present dataset, mass consistency is achieved by iteratively adjusting the horizontal wind field at every time step. </p>\n<p>The divergence and tendency terms from this dataset can be combined to indirectly estimate mass-consistent surface flux terms of the atmospheric energy and moisture budget. In the energy budget, horizontal and vertical enthalpy fluxes associated with water and snow are neglected. This framework allows for unambiguous estimation of net surface heat fluxes (sum of radiative and turbulent heat fluxes) when combined with net radiative fluxes  at the top of the atmosphere (not included in this dataset).  The divergence and tendency term of the atmospheric moisture budget can be combined to indirectly estimate surface freshwater fluxes (P+E) which have an unbiased global mean.</p>\n<p>In addition,  this dataset allows the computation of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The divergence of total energy flux with temperature-independent latent heat of vaporization is obtained by subtracting the divergence of latent heat flux and add the divergence of water vapour flux multiplied by L<sub>v</sub> = 2.5008 J kg<sup>-1</sup> instead (this works analogously for tendency and transport terms).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divergence fields with full spectral resolution can be derived from corresponding east- and northward transports (divergence terms in this dataset are truncated at wave number 180 to reduce artificial noise over high topography).  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This dataset is produced on behalf of Copernicus Climate Change Service by the Department of Meteorology and Geophysics, University of Vienna.</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Global</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>0.25\u00b0x 0.25\u00b0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td>Integrated from surface to top of atmosphere</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td>Single level</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>From January 1979 to present</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Monthly</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF 4</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Versions</th><td>Present version is 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>Yearly with a delay of about 4 months relatively to real time</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Divergence of vertical integral of  latent heat flux</td><td class='variables-units'>W m<sup>-2</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>This variable is the horizontal rate of flow of latent heat integrated over an atmospheric column extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere.
