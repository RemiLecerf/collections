Data are then aggregated  on daily, monthly, seasonal and annual averages.\nFor wind speed, the field at 10 metres was bias-adjusted and then extrapolated to 100 metres using a stability-dependent logarithmic scaling.</p>\n<p>The dataset was generated by one of the Sectoral Information System (SIS) proof of concept contracts led by the University of East Anglia  to the the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\nThe aim of the European Climatic Energy Mixes (ECEM) contract \u2013 which worked in close collaboration with a set of prospective users \u2013 was to enable the energy industry and policy makers to assess how well different energy supply mixes in Europe will meet demand, over different time horizons from seasonal to long-term decadal, focusing on the role climate has on the mixes.</p>\n         <p><i>More details about the products are given in the Documentation section.</i></p>\n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Projection</th><td>Regular latitude-longitude grid</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>European</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>1979-2016</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Daily</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Air temperature</td><td class='variables-units'>C</td><td class='variables-description'>Temperature of the air at about 2m above the surface.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Dewpoint depression</td><td class='variables-units'>C</td><td class='variables-description'>Difference between air and dewpoint temperatures.
