However, there is a lack of rigorous definitions for heat waves and cold spells. This dataset combines multiple definitions and allows the user to compare European-wide definitions with national/regional definitions.</p>\n<p>First, the temperature statistics are calculated, either for the season winter and summer or for the whole year, based on a bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX dataset. Then, the statistics are averaged for 30 years as a smoothed average from 1971 to 2100. This results in a timeseries covering the period from 1986 to 2085. Finally, the timeseries are averaged for the model ensemble and the standard deviation to this ensemble mean is provided. </p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Projection</th><td>Regular latitude-longitude grid.</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>European region (Extent: ~ 27N \u2013 72N, ~22W \u2013 45E)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0 </td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>From 1986 to  2085</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Year (season average)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF 4</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6, Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) v1.3</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>No updates expected.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Cold spell days</td><td class='variables-units'>days</td><td class='variables-description'>Number of cold  days in a year  using  specific definitions.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Heat wave days</td><td class='variables-units'>days</td><td class='variables-description'>Number of hot  days in a year  using  specific definitions.</td></tr>\n</table>\n    </div>",
