The provided indicators are the climatic suitability for the presence of Aedes albopictus and the season length of presence of Aedes albopictus. This mosquito transmits vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya.</p>\n<p>Environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall impact the survival chance and seasonal activity of Aedes albopictus. In Europe, the environmental conditions become more favorable for the establishment of Aedes albopictus, which is a serious threat for human health in Europe.</p>\n<p>The temperature statistics are calculated, either for the season winter and summer or for the whole year, based on a bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX dataset. Then, the statistics are averaged for 30 years as a smoothed average from 1971 to 2100. This results in a timeseries covering the period from 1986 to 2085. Finally, the timeseries are averaged for the model ensemble and the standard deviation to this ensemble mean is provided. </p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Projection</th><td>Regular latitude-longitude grid.</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>European region (approximately 27N \u2013 72N, 22W \u2013 45E)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>1986 \u2013 2085</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Season or year, that represents the 30-yr smoothed average around that particular season or year.</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6, Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) v1.3</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>No updates expected.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Season length</td><td class='variables-units'>Day</td><td class='variables-description'>Duration of\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0presence in weeks.
