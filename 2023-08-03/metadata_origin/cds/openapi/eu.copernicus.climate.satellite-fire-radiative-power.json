    "rich_abstract": "<div class='abstract-text'>\n         <p>This dataset provides  active fire (AF) and fire radiative power (FRP) products derived from observations made by the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) operating concurrently onboard the European Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites.  These products are generated from  the non-time critical (NTC) Level 2 AF detection and FRP product from European Space Agency (ESA). The AF, FRP and the Burnt Areas are Essential Climate Variables (ECV) from the Global Observing System for Climate (GCOS). Burnt Area is provided through a different catalogue entry.</p>\n<p>The AF and the FRP products encompass a Level 2 summary product which provides a text-based table summary of the Level 2 AF detection and FRP data collected over the period of one month across the globe. In addition,  three gridded Level 3 \u2018synthesis products\u2019 are also provided, each one grids the Level 2 AF and the FRP data at various spatial and temporal resolutions along with some adjustments for cloud cover that blocks the fires from the satellite sensors view. The following gridded products are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>daily global Level 3 FRP product generated on a global 0.1 degree resolution grid. AF data coming from observations made by both Sentinel-3A (S3A) and -3B (S3B) have separate layers in this product. Only night-time land observations are included at this moment, the full daytime will be provided in the future once the corresponding NTC Level 2 FRP data are available.</li>\n<li>27 day global Level 3 FRP product also derived at 0.1 degree grid cell resolution but summarising the FRP data from both Sentinel-3A and -3B. This time period matches the Sentinel-3 satellites standard orbital repeat cycle.</li>\n<li>monthly global Level 3 FRP product which provides global AF detection and FRP data at a grid cell size of 0.25 degrees. This resolution matches the MODIS Climate Modelling Grid (CMG) active fire product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of these AF and FRP products is to provide a summarised and 'easy to use' version of the Level 2 AF and FRP products, as well as providing the AF and FRP information in a consistently gridded format. The latter in particular is designed to be suitable for use in global modelling, trend analysis and model evaluation.</p>\n<p>The AF and  FRP were produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service and have been designed to be broadly comparable with the equivalent <a href=\"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-fire-burned-area?tab=overview\">Fire Burnt Area</a> product, since they are likely to be used in combination with them to provide a long-term FRP time-series.</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td><p>Gridded for the gridded product</p>\n<p>Point data for the summary product</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Global</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td><p>0.1\u00b0x 0.1\u00b0 and   0.25\u00b0x 0.25\u00b0   for the gridded product </p>\n<p>Point data (based on 1km observations) for the summary product</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td>Surface</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td>Single level</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>From March 2020 to present</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td><p>Daily, 27 days (Sentinel-3 repeat cycle)  and  monthly for the gridded product</p>\n<p>Individual time stamps of active fire events, monthly files for the summary product</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td><p>NetCDF4 for the gridded product</p>\n<p>CSV for the summary product</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td><p>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.7</p>\n<p>ESA CCI Data Standards [DSWG 2015] for the gridded product</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Versions</th><td>1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>February every year</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Active pixels</td><td class='variables-units'>Count</td><td class='variables-description'>Total number of active fire pixels in a grid cell for either Sentinel-3A or Sentinel-3B.

It is expressed in Watts (Joules per Sec). Within a single pixels field of view there can be many landscape fires burning and thus the FRP recorded is that of all fires within the pixel, and is typically expressed in MWatts (MW). The FRP is measured at night either by Sentinel-3A or -3B and when derived from MWIR (middle infrared) channel observations, which are those most suitable for landscape fire FRP estimation, is termed FRP_MWIR in the netCDF files. NetCDF files also provides FRP_SWIR, which is the same FRP metric as represented by FRP_MWIR, but now derived using SWIR channel observations. This form of FRP derivation is more suited to phenomena of higher temperature than landscape fires, most notably industrial gas flares. </td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Mean fire radiative power</td><td class='variables-units'>MW</td><td class='variables-description'>Rate of radiant heat output from a fire.
