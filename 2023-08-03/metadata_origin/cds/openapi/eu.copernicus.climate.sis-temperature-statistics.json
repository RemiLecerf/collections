    "rich_abstract": "<div class='abstract-text'>\n         <p>This dataset contains temperature exposure statistics for Europe (e.g. percentiles) derived from the daily 2 metre mean, minimum and maximum air temperature for the entire year, winter (DJF: December-January-February) and summer (JJA: June-July-August). These statistics were derived within the C3S European Health service and are available for different future time periods and using different climate change scenarios.</p>\n<p>Temperature percentiles are typically used in epidemiology and public health when defining health risk estimates and when looking at current and future health impacts, and they allow to identify a common threshold and comparison between different cities/areas. </p>\n<p>The temperature statistics are calculated, either for the season winter and summer or for the whole year, based on a bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX dataset. The statistics are averaged for 30 years as a smoothed average from 1971 to 2100. This results in a timeseries covering the period from 1986 to 2085. Finally, the timeseries are averaged for the model ensemble and the standard deviation to this ensemble mean is provided. </p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Projection</th><td>Regular latitude-longitude grid.</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>European region  (approximately 27N \u2013 72N, 22W \u2013 45E)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>1986 \u2013 2085</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Season or year, that represents the 30-yr smoothed average around that particular season or year.</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6, Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) v1.3</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>No updates expected.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Average temperature</td><td class='variables-units'>K</td><td class='variables-description'>Daily average air temperature valid for a grid cell at the height of 2m above the surface, averaged over the year or season.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Maximum temperature</td><td class='variables-units'>K</td><td class='variables-description'>Daily maximum air temperature valid for a grid cell at the height of 2m above the surface, averaged over the year or season.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Minimum temperature</td><td class='variables-units'>K</td><td class='variables-description'>Daily minimum air temperature valid for a grid cell at the height of 2m above the surface, averaged over the year or season.</td></tr>\n</table>\n    </div>",
