      <dct:abstract>This dataset provides bias-corrected reconstruction of near-surface meteorological variables derived from the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts  (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalyses (ERA5). It is intended to be used as a meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models. 
The dataset has been obtained using the same methodology used to derive the widely used water, energy and climate change (WATCH) forcing data, and is thus also referred to as WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA5 (WFDE5). The data are derived from the ERA5 reanalysis product that have been re-gridded to a half-degree resolution. Data have been adjusted using an elevation correction and monthly-scale bias corrections based on Climatic Research Unit (CRU) data (for temperature, diurnal temperature range, cloud-cover, wet days number and precipitation fields) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data (for precipitation fields only). Additional corrections are included for varying atmospheric aerosol-loading and separate precipitation gauge observations. For full details please refer to the product user-guide.
This dataset was produced on behalf of Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and was generated entirely within the Climate Data Store (CDS) Toolbox. The toolbox source code is provided in the documentation tab.

Variables in the dataset/application are:
Grid-point altitude, Near-surface air temperature, Near-surface specific humidity, Near-surface wind speed, Rainfall flux, Snowfall flux, Surface air pressure, Surface downwelling longwave radiation, Surface downwelling shortwave radiation</dct:abstract>
