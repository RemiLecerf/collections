      <dct:abstract>The C3S Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) dataset contains 3-hourly analyses and hourly short term forecasts of atmospheric and surface meteorological variables (surface and near-surface temperature, surface and top of atmosphere fluxes, precipitation, cloud, humidity, wind,  pressure, snow and sea variables) at 2.5 km resolution. Additionally, forecasts up to 30 hours initialised from the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available.
The dataset includes two domains. The West domain covers Greenland, the Labrador Sea, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Denmark Strait, Iceland, Jan Mayen, the Greenland Sea, and parts of Svalbard. The East domain covers Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, Barents Sea, and the Northern parts of the Norwegian Sea and Scandinavia.
The dataset has been produced with the use of the HARMONIE-AROME state-of-the-art non-hydrostatic regional numerical weather prediction model. High resolution reanalysis for the Arctic region is particularly important because the climate change is more pronounced in the Arctic region than elsewhere in the Earth. This fact calls for a better description of this region providing additional details with respect to the global reanalyses (ERA5 for instance). The additional information is provided by the higher horizontal resolution, more local observations (from the Nordic countries and Greenland), better description of surface characteristics (high resolution satellite and physiographic data), high resolution non-hydrostatic dynamics and improved physical parameterisation of clouds and precipitation in particular.
The inputs to CARRA reanalysis are the observations, the ERA5 global reanalysis as lateral boundary conditions and the physiographic datasets describing the surface characteristics of the model. The observation values and information about their quality are used together to constrain the reanalysis where observations are available and provide information for the data assimilation system in areas in where less observations are available.
More details about the reanalysis dataset and the extensive input data are given in the Documentation section.

Variables in the dataset/application are:
10m eastward wind gust since previous post-processing, 10m northward wind gust since previous post-processing, 10m u-component of wind, 10m v-component of wind, 10m wind direction, 10m wind gust since previous post-processing, 10m wind speed, 2m relative humidity, 2m specific humidity, 2m temperature, Albedo, Cloud base, Cloud top, Direct solar radiation, Evaporation, Fog (lowest model level cloud), Fraction of snow cover, High cloud cover, Land-sea mask, Low cloud cover, Maximum 2m temperature since previous post-processing, Mean sea level pressure, Medium cloud cover, Minimum 2m temperature since previous post-processing, Orography, Percolation, Precipitation type, Sea ice area fraction, Sea ice surface temperature, Sea ice thickness, Sea surface temperature, Skin temperature, Snow albedo, Snow density, Snow depth water equivalent, Snow on ice total depth, Surface latent heat flux, Surface net solar radiation, Surface net solar radiation, clear sky, Surface net thermal radiation, Surface net thermal radiation, clear sky, Surface pressure, Surface roughness, Surface roughness length for heat, Surface runoff, Surface sensible heat flux, Surface solar radiation downwards, Surface thermal radiation downwards, Time integral of rain flux, Time integral of snow evaporation flux, Time integral of surface eastward momentum flux, Time integral of surface latent heat evaporation flux, Time integral of surface latent heat sublimation flux, Time integral of surface northward momentum flux, Time integral of total solid precipitation flux, Time-integrated surface direct short wave radiation flux, Top net solar radiation, Top net thermal radiation, Total cloud cover, Total column cloud ice water, Total column cloud liquid water, Total column graupel, Total column integrated water vapour, Total precipitation, Visibility, Volumetric soil ice, Volumetric soil moisture</dct:abstract>
