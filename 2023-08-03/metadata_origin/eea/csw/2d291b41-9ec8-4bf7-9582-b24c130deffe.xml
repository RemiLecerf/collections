      <dct:abstract>The pan-European Very High Resolution (VHR) Image Mosaic 2012 provides optical VHR2 (Very High Resolution: &gt; 1m and &lt;= 4m) coverage over Europe.

The surface covered by the image dataset is 7,3 million square kilometres and has a spatial resolution of 2,5 m. The acquisition window of the imagery is January 2011 to December 2013. Images are derived from the following satellite sensors:
&#8226; SPOT-5 at 2.5m pan-sharpened
&#8226; SPOT-6 at 1.5 m pan-sharpened
&#8226; FORMOSAT-2 at 2m pan-sharpened

The mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.

The input imagery for the creation of the mosaic is provided by ESA. Due to license restrictions, VHR Image Mosaic 2012 is only available as a web service (WMS), and not for data download.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The source data are based mainly on Spot-5 scenes, with additional SPOT-6 scenes over northern Europe, provided by Astrium/Airbus DS. The original SPOT-5 data allow only a display in false-colour band combination due to the missing blue band. For the usage inside a public view services however a natural-colour-like display is strongly preferred. The JRC processed the Core003 source data and created a seamless mosaic with a natural-colour display, calculating the blue band based on the available bands. A cloud-free optimization and histogram equalization were applied for best visual impression in a view service.

The SPOT-5 2,5 m product is constructed out of the 5 m  pan and 10 m MS (and 20 m on SWIR) of SPOT-5. It is obtained by merging two separate images, one in panchromatic mode at 2,5 m resolution and the other in three-band multispectral mode at 10-metre resolution. The 2,5 m image is itself generated by merging two 5 m images, for which one of the HRG instruments has to acquire three images simultaneously to produce a 2,5 m colour image. Images thus obtained are like a three-band colour image, with a resolution of 2,5 m and panchromatic viewing geometry.
