      <dct:abstract>EU-Hydro is a dataset for all EEA38 countries and United Kingdom providing photo-interpreted river network, consistent of surface interpretation of water bodies (lakes and wide rivers), and a drainage model (also called Drainage Network), derived from EU-DEM, with catchments and drainage lines and nodes. 
This metadata refers to the EU-Hydro coastline, which is disseminated as one shapefile merged for all 35 basins. The coastline is also included for each basin in the EU-Hydro River Network Database. 
The production of EU-Hydro and the derived layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Space imagery SP05 (resolution 2.5 m) and SP06 (resolution 2.5 m), space imagery IMAGE2009 (resolution 20 m), EEA member countries WFD reporting data on water bodies: for T&#252;rkiye (EEA member), Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo (UNSCR 1244/99) and Serbia (all EEA cooperating countries) no spatial data for any category of water bodies was available, European Catchments and Rivers Network System (ECRINS); ancillary data: European Lakes and Reservoirs database (Eldred), Russian topographic maps. The upgrade of the EU-Hydro beta version includes improvements of the usability of the dataset, of its topological and logical consistency and the River network characteristics. Catchments layers were also modified to fit the River networks. Topological overlapping and gaps between River Basin Districts were corrected. The EU-Hydro V1.1 upgrade includes the reclassification of polygons between InlandWater, Coastal-p, Transit_p and River_Net_p classes, the upgrade of the WFD codes using the WISE geospatial dataset for these feature classes, the improvement of logical consistency of attribute tables (deletion of irrelevant fields, recalculation of OBJECT_ID field, recalculation of geometry properties field). In Version 1.2 the Drainage network derived from EUDEM was incorporated to the river network of EU hydro: four feature classes were generated: River_Net_l_DN, Canals_l_DN, Ditches_l_DN and Nodes_DN. River names were updated using WISE geospatial database, except for Thames, Tweed and T&#252;rkiye where ECRINS was used instead. In version 1.3, "River_Net_l" topology was adjusted to fit Coastal_p and Transit_p: polylines were deleted for Gota, Skjern, Shannon, Tweed. Polylines were added in Skjern, Mesima and Tajo on areas overlapping Transit_p. Nodes were modified accordingly. CUM_LEN, LONGPATH, LENGTH GEO fields were recalculated.
More information about the product is available with the dataset in the user manual, also available at the CLMS website: https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/eu-hydro_user_guide.pdf.</dc:source>
