      <dct:abstract>The pan-European High Resolution (HR) Image Mosaic 2015 provides up to two cloud-free HR optical coverage 1 of EEA39 countries including all islands of those countries plus French Overseas Departments (DOMs) acquired within predefined windows corresponding to the vegetation season in 2014-2015.

Images are derived from the following satellite sensors:

Resourcesat-1/2
SPOT-5
Sentinel-2 MSI

The mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.

The input imagery for the creation of the mosaic is provided by ESA. Due to license restrictions, HR Image Mosaic 2015 is only available as a web service (WMS), and not for data download.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Presence of perennial snow and glaciers is to be expected in products.
Haze: acceptability assessed by EEA.
The sun elevation angle is higher than 20&#176; to ensure sufficient illumination and to minimize the effect of shadows
The off-nadir viewing angle is less than 25&#176;.
Pixel alignment: The values of the coordinates for the upper-left corner (x and y) of the upper-left pixel of an image dataset shall be an integer multiple of the pixel size (resolution) in the corresponding direction (x and y)</dc:source>
