      <dct:abstract>The High Resolution Layer Imperviousness Change (IMC) 2015-2018 is a 20m raster dataset showing change in imperviousness between 2015 and 2018 reference years, produced in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.

The high resolution imperviousness products capture the percentage and change of soil sealing. Built-up areas are characterized by the substitution of the original (semi-) natural land cover or water surface with an artificial, often impervious cover. These artificial surfaces are usually maintained over long periods of time. A series of high resolution imperviousness datasets (for the 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018 reference years) with all artificially sealed areas was produced using automatic derivation based on calibrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This series of imperviousness layers constitutes the main status layers. They are per-pixel estimates of impermeable cover of soil (soil sealing) and are mapped as the degree of imperviousness (0-100%). Imperviousness change layers were produced as a difference between the reference years (2006-2009, 2009-2012, 2012-2015, 2015-2018 and additionally 2006-2012, to fully match the CORINE Land Cover production cycle) and are presented 1) as degree of imperviousness change (-100% -- +100%), in 20m and 100m pixel size, and 2) a classified (categorical) 20m change product. 

This dataset is provided as 20 meter rasters (fully conformant with EEA reference grid) in 100 x 100 km tiles grouped according to the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Quality assurance follows the ISO9000 standards for Quality Management and comprises of dedicated procedures of ongoing quality checks (QA breakpoints) during implementation of the production chain, in order to keep persistent control over the various stages of production, assure fitness-for-purpose of the end-products and that all quality requirements are fulfilled. Priority has been given to the target thematic accuracies to be achieved by each product, as well as to the issues of product consistency (spatial, thematic, temporal) and homogeneity. Quality Assessment: The quality assessment has been performed according to INSPIRE Data Specifications. The data quality elements considered are:
(i) Completeness,
(ii) Logical Consistency,
(iii) Thematic Accuracy,
(iv) Temporal quality and
(v) Usability.
Each of them (excl. the Thematic Accuracy hereafter) forms a section in the QA/QC Procedures.

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that we are currently investigating the reliability of the magnitude of imperviousness increase that was mapped for the 2015-2018 period. The change products (as mapped) show a significant increase of the speed to soil sealing/imperviousness as compared to the previous periods for which we have change data (2006-2009, 2009-2012 and 2012-2015). We are confident that the trend and the spatial pattern of the trend reflects reality, but the magnitude of the increase needs to be further investigated.
