      <dct:abstract>The Copernicus High Resolution Forest Layer Tree Cover Change Mask (TCCM) 2012-2015 raster product provides information on the change between the reference years 2012 and 2015 and consists of 4 thematic classes (unchanged areas with no tree cover / new tree cover / loss of tree cover / unchanged areas with tree cover) at 20m spatial resolution and covers EEA38 area and the United Kingdom. The production of the High Resolution Forest layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.

The High Resolution Forest product consists of three types of (status) products and additional change products. The status products are available for the 2012, 2015 and 2018 reference years: 1. Tree cover density providing level of tree cover density in a range from 0-100%; 2. Dominant leaf type providing information on the dominant leaf type: broadleaved or coniferous; 3. A Forest type product. The forest type product allows to get as close as possible to the FAO forest definition. In its original (20m) resolution it consists of two products: 1) a dominant leaf type product that has a MMU of 0.5 ha, as well as a 10% tree cover density threshold applied, and 2) a support layer that maps, based on the dominant leaf type product, trees under agricultural use and in urban context (derived from CLC and high resolution imperviousness 2009 data). For the final 100m product trees under agricultural use and urban context from the support layer are removed.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The Tree Cover Change Mask (TCCM) 2012-2015 is a change product based on the experimental and unpublished Dominant Leaf Type Change (DLTC) product 2012-2015 from the HRL 2015 production. First, the experimental DLTC product has been recoded to the new TCCM specifications of the HRL 2018 production. Subsequently, the resulting change classes are filtered according to the specified Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 1 ha. The product covers the whole EEA39 area and is provided in European projection. National products might show a broken MMU due to reprojection.
Quality assurance follows the ISO 9001:2015 standards for Quality Management and comprises of dedicated procedures of quality checks (QA breakpoints) during implementation of the production chain, in order to keep persistent control over the various stages of production, assure fitness-for-purpose of the end-products and that all quality requirements are fulfilled. Priority has been given to the target thematic accuracy to be achieved by each product, as well as to the issues of product consistency (spatial, thematic, temporal) and homogeneity. Quality Assessment: The quality assessment has been performed according to INSPIRE Data Specifications. The data quality elements considered are: (i) Completeness, (ii) Logical Consistency, (iii) positional accuracy, (iv) Thematic Accuracy, (v) Temporal quality and (vi) Usability.
Geometric accuracy (positioning scale): Less than one pixel (20m) according to ortho-rectified satellite image base delivered by ESA. 
Thematic target accuracy: not assessed.

The production process is described and explained in detail in the User Manual Tree-cover/forest and change 2015-2018 on: https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/forest-2018-user-manual.pdf.</dc:source>
