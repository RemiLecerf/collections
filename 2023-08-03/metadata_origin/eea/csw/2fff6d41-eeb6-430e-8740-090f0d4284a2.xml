      <dct:abstract>This metadata refers to the CLMS N2K Change 2012-2018 product, the Copernicus Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) change map tailored to the needs of biodiversity monitoring in selected Natura2000 sites: 4790 sites of natural and semi-natural grassland formations listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive, including a 2km buffer zone surrounding the sites. The change mapping exercise between the reference years 2012 and 2018, was based on the comparison of VHR satellite data and occurred over an area of 631.800 km&#178; across Europe (i.e. EU27, the United Kingdom and Switzerland). The change dataset only shows the areas that have changed between 2012 and 2018 and covers an area of 1.199.652 ha.
LC/LU is extracted from VHR satellite data and other available data. Change detection is based on the analysis of VHR satellite data from the reference years 2012 &#177;2 years and 2018 &#177;1 year.
The production of N2K updates was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Computer assisted change detection of LC/LU between the reference years 2012 and 2018 extracted from VHR satellite data and other available data. The change mapping exercise between the reference years 2012 and 2018, was based on the comparison of VHR satellite data and occurred over an area of 631.800 km&#178; across Europe (i.e. within the selected Natura2000 sites and including a 2km buffer zone surrounding those). The change dataset only shows the areas that have changed between 2012 and 2018 and covers an area of 1.199.652 ha. The production of this dataset is the basis for the status map 2018 as well as for the revision of the previous time steps 2012 and 2006.
The classification provides 55 distinct thematic classes. The class definitions follow a pre-defined nomenclature based on the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) typology of ecosystems (at level 1) and are further harmonised with Corine Land Cover and adapted to the specific characteristics of grasslands habitats (levels 2 to 4). Each change polygon is identified with a change code that shows the initial class and the change class. The Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is 0.5 ha and the Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) is 10 m. The positional accuracy is less than 5 m (according to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA: less than 5m RMSE). Producer&#8217;s accuracy assessment approach: stratified random point sampling. Interpretation of sampling points was performed on the best available reference data. The overall accuracy is higher than 80%.
