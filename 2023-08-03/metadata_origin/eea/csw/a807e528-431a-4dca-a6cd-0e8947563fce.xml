      <dct:abstract>The Share of Built-up (SBU) layer for the reference year 2018 represents share (percentage) of built-up (IBU) for the reference year 2018 in an aggregated version of 100m spatial resolution for the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom. The production of the high resolution imperviousness layers is coordinated by the EEA in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme. 

The high resolution imperviousness products capture the percentage and change of soil sealing. Built-up areas are characterized by the substitution of the original (semi-) natural land cover or water surface with an artificial, often impervious cover. These artificial surfaces are usually maintained over long periods of time. A series of high resolution imperviousness datasets (for the 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018 reference years) with all artificially sealed areas was produced using automatic derivation based on calibrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This series of imperviousness layers constitutes the main status layers. They are per-pixel estimates of impermeable cover of soil (soil sealing) and are mapped as the degree of imperviousness (0-100%). Imperviousness change layers were produced as a difference between the reference years (2006-2009, 2009-2012, 2012-2015, 2015-2018 and additionally 2006-2012, to fully match the CORINE Land Cover production cycle) and are presented 1) as degree of imperviousness change (-100% -- +100%), in 20m and 100m pixel size, and 2) a classified (categorical) 20m change product.

The 100 meter aggregate raster (fully conformant with the EEA reference grid) is provided as a full EEA38 and United Kingdom mosaic.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Quality assurance follows the ISO9000 standards for Quality Management and comprises of dedicated procedures of on-going quality checks (QA breakpoints) during implementation of the production chain, in order to keep persistent control over the various stages of production, assure fitness-for-purpose of the end-products and that all quality requirements are fulfilled. Priority will be given to the target thematic accuracies to be achieved by each product, as well as to the issues of product consistency (spatial, thematic, temporal) and homogeneity.
Quality Assessment: The quality assessment has been performed according to INSPIRE Data Specifications. The data quality elements considered are:
Completeness,
Logical Consistency,
Thematic Accuracy,
Temporal quality and
Usability.
Each of them (excl. the Thematic Accuracy hereafter) forms a section in the QA/QC Procedures.
