      <dct:abstract>The Copernicus High Resolution Water and Wetness (WAW) 2015 layer is a thematic product showing the occurrence of water and wet surfaces over the period from 2009 to 2015 for the EEA38 area and the United Kingdom . This metadata corresponds to the aggregation of the 20m classified product into a 100m raster. The production of the High Resolution Water and Wetness layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.

Two WAW products are available:
- The main Water and Wetness (WAW) product, with defined classes of (1) permanent water, (2) temporary water, (3) permanent wetness and (4) temporary wetness.
- The additional expert product: Water and Wetness Probability Index (WWPI).
The products show the occurrence of water and indicate the degree of wetness in a physical sense, assessed independently of the actual vegetation cover and are thus not limited to a specific land cover class and their relative frequencies.

Data is provided as a mosaic of the full area, and as tiles with a side length of 1000 km x 1000 km. In 2020, due to methodological improvements, the temporary wet class has been reprocessed during the update for the 2018 reference year.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The 20m classified Water and Wetness layer is aggregated to 100m for the complete European LAEA layer according to the following procedure: for the aggregation of the 20m classified product to a 100m raster in a concise way, all underlying 20m cells are considered. A majority rule is applied to ensure that the most appropriate class value is given to the 100m cell, considering all underlying 25 pixels that are covered by the 100m raster cell. The 100m cell receives the code of the majority of 20m pixels, under consideration of the fraction of valid and un-valid pixels and equality. More information about this procedure and the overall product can be found here: https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/hrl-water-wetness-technical-document-prod-2015. In 2020, due to methodological improvements, the temporary wet class has been reprocessed during the update for the 2018 reference year.

Quality assurance follows the ISO9000 standards for Quality Management and comprises of dedicated procedures of on-going quality checks (QA breakpoints) during implementation of the production chain, in order to keep persistent control over the various stages of production, assure fitness-for-purpose of the end-products and that all quality requirements are fulfilled. Priority will be given to the target thematic accuracies to be achieved by each product, as well as to the issues of product consistency (spatial, thematic, temporal) and homogeneity.
Quality Assessment: The quality assessment has been performed according to INSPIRE Data Specifications. The data quality elements considered are:
(i) Completeness,
(ii) Logical Consistency,
(iii) Thematic Accuracy,
(iv) Temporal quality and (v) Usability.
Each of them (excl. the Thematic Accuracy hereafter) forms a section in the QA/QC Procedures.</dc:source>
