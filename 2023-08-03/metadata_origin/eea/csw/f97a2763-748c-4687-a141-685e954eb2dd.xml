      <dct:abstract>The pan-European High Resolution (HR) Image Mosaic 2018 provides cloud-free high resolution true colour imagery for EEA39 countries. The mosaic has been produced using Sentinel-2 data in 10 meter resolution, at a Sentinel 2 tile level, and consists of 1079 Sentinel-2 tiles. The imagery for each state is acquired within a predefined window corresponding to the vegetation season in 2018.

The true colour (RGB) composite consists of a three band stack and includes the following bands:
Band 4 &#8211; Red (0.665 &#956;m)
Band 3 &#8211; Green (0.560 &#956;m)
Band 2 &#8211; Blue (0.490 &#956;m)

The mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.

Since the pan-European High Resolution Mosaic  2018 is created exclusively from Sentinel-2 data, the imagery can be downloaded from The Copernicus Open Access Hub (mission ongoing since 2015) at https://scihub.copernicus.eu/. Global Sentinel-2 Image Mosaics Hub at https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/global-image-mosaics/ can be also used to automatically create mosaics over the area of interest.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Presence of perennial snow and glaciers is to be expected in products.
Haze: acceptability assessed by EEA.
The sun elevation angle is higher than 20&#176; to ensure sufficient illumination and to minimize the effect of shadows
The off-nadir viewing angle is less than 25&#176;.
Pixel alignment: The values of the coordinates for the upper-left corner (x and y) of the upper-left pixel of an image dataset shall be an integer multiple of the pixel size (resolution) in the corresponding direction (x and y)
Time window:
A narrow time window for the 2018 growing season was respected where possible. If too many clouds, gaps, or cloud shadow artefacts were observed in the tile, the time window was extended to utilize a slightly wider time window. This was fully utilized in Iceland and the UK and Ireland. Various other tiles within the dataset were also processed using the wide time window. Iceland was an extreme case, and around Vatnaj&#246;kull National Park data from 2017 was used to gapfill. In this area the 2018 composite was overlayed on top of a clearest image from 2017 to avoid no-data gaps. The 2017 and 2019 data usage is minimal throughout the coverage.</dc:source>
