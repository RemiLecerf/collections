      <dct:abstract>Riparian zones represent transitional areas occurring between land and freshwater ecosystems, characterised by distinctive hydrology, soil and biotic conditions and strongly influenced by the stream water. They provide a wide range of riparian functions (e.g. chemical filtration, flood control, bank stabilization, aquatic life and riparian wildlife support, etc.) and ecosystem services.

The Riparian Zones products support the objectives of several European legal acts and policy initiatives, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Water Framework Directive.

This metadata refers to the Riparian Zones 2018  Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU), which LC/LU classification is tailored to the needs of biodiversity monitoring in a variable buffer zone of selected rivers (Strahler levels 2-9 derived from EU-Hydro) for the reference year 2018. LC/LU is extracted from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite data and other available data in a buffer zone of selected rivers for supporting biodiversity monitoring and mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services. The class definitions follow the pre-defined nomenclature on the basis of Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) typology of ecosystems (Level 1 to Level 4) and CORINE Land Cover. The classification provides 55 distinct thematic classes with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha and a Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of 10 m.

The production of the Riparian Zones products was coordinated by the European Environment Agency in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Computer assisted visual interpretation of the status 2018 data compared to the LC/LU product for reference year 2012. The main dataset for visual image interpretation was the VHR_IMAGE_2018 dataset (Optical VHR coverage of EEA-39 2017-2019), consisting of 2m Pleiades, Kompsat 3/3A, SuperView-1 and 4m SPOT-6/7, TripleSat, PlanetScope and Deimos satellite data. Subsequently, intersection of classification results with additional data (Urban Atlas 2012) was performed.

The current LC/LU layer differentiates 55 thematic LC/LU classes covering Strahler levels 2 to 9 for the reference year 2018.

Positional Accuracy: less than 5 m (according to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA: less than 5m RMSE). Thematic accuracy (area-corrected Overall Accuracy, internal validation): 95.56% (at CODE_4 level) for status layer 2018 and 98.97% (at CODE_1 level) for change layer 2012-2018. Accuracy Assessment approach: Stratified Random Point Sampling with 1669 sampling points for both, 2018 status layer and 2012-2018 change layer. Interpretation of sampling points has been performed on the best available reference data.</dc:source>
