  "description": "The product contains the gridded daily series of mean temperature at 250-m spatial resolution for the region Trentino – South Tyrol. The dataset currently spans the period 1980 – 2020, but it is expected to be regularly updated. It was obtained by applying an anomaly-based interpolation to the observations of more than 200 station sites of the regional meteorological network and some extra-regional sites close to the borders. All station series used for deriving the gridded fields were prior checked for quality and homogeneity and they are stored in the Climate Database: https://edp-portal.eurac.edu/cdb_doc/. Mean temperature was here defined as the daily average of maximum and minimum temperature. Further details can be found in the published paper (Crespi et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2801-2021). The dataset is also available in PANGAEA repository (Crespi et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924502).",
