This collection includes all the Sentinel-2 bands in 10 meters resolution and a CLOUD_MASK band generated by s2cloudless, where the clouds have values 1 and no clouds 0. The original bands that would have 20m or 60m resolution have been resampled to 10m using a nearest neighbor interpolation automatically by ODC.",
