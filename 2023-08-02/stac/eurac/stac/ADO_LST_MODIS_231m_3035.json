  "description": "The Land Surface Temperature (LST) is based on MODIS satellite data. The LST is based on 8 day MOD11A2 (v006) LST products. The spatial resolution is 231 m after regridding from the original 1000 m resolution. The LST is masked to the highest quality standards using the provided quality layers. Missing pixel values in the time series are linearly interpolated. Non-vegetatated areas are masked using the MODIS land cover product layer MCD12Q1 FAO-Land Cover Classification System 1 (LCCS1). The final product is regridded to the LAEA Projection (EPSG:3035). The Land Surface Temperature is expressed in degree Celsius.",
