  "description": "The Temperature Condition Index (TCI) is based on the Land Surface Temperature (LST) MODIS satellite data. The LST is based on 8 day MOD11A2 (v006) LST products. The spatial resolution is 231 m after regridding from the original 1000 m resolution. The LST is masked to the highest quality standards using the provided quality layers. Missing pixel values in the time series are linearly interpolated. Non-vegetated areas are masked using the most recent Corine Land Cover product version for the according year. The final product is regridded to the LAEA Projection (EPSG:3035). The TCI is calculated using the formula TCIi = (LSTmax,i - LSTi)/(LSTmax,i - LSTmin,i) * 100. The TCI expresses anomalies of the LST. The data is provided as 8 day measures. The time series is starting from 2001. The TCI values range from 0-100, whereas high values correspond to optimal vegetation conditions and low values indicate unfavorable vegetation conditions. ",
