  "description": "ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. ERA5-Land offers 'land' variables with an enhanced resolution, compared to ERA5. Albeit, at the time of processing with a higher latency. Therefore, ERA5 was downscaled to the 9 km ERA5-Land grid using a quantile mapping approach. The soil moisture anomalies are based on the original ERA5 fields 'Volumetric soil water layer 1 - 4', representing the following depths: layer 1 (0-7cm), layer 2 (7-28cm), layer 3 (28-100 cm), layer 4 (100-289 cm). Anomalies were calculated based on the period 1981-2010 as a reference. Contains modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information [1980-current year]; Contains modified Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service information [1980-current year]. Neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is responsible for any use that may be made of the Copernicus information or data it contains.",
