  "description": "The product contains the gridded climatologies of monthly mean temperature for Trentino – South Tyrol for the period 1981–2010. The dataset was obtained by interpolating on a 250-m resolution grid the observed monthly climatologies of more than 200 station sites of the regional meteorological network and some extra-regional sites close to the borders. All observation data used for deriving the gridded fields were prior checked for quality and homogeneity and they are stored in the Climate Database:https://edp-portal.eurac.edu/cdb_doc/. Mean temperature was here defined as the average of maximum and minimum temperature. The climatologies represent the mean values over a reference 30-year period. Further details can be found in the published paper (Crespi et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2801-2021). The dataset is also available in PANGAEA repository (Crespi et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924502)",
