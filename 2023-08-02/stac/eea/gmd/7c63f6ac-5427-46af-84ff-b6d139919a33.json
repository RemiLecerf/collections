  "description": "The pan-European High Resolution (HR) Image Mosaic 2009 provides HR2 (High Resolution: 20 meter) coverage over Europe.\n\nThe surface covered by the image dataset is 5.8 million square kilometres and has a spatial resolution of 20 meters. The imagery is composed during specific acquisition windows between 2008 and 2010. Images are derived from the following satellite sensors:\n\nResourcesat-1\nSPOT-4/-5\n\nThe mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.\n\nThe input imagery for the creation of the mosaic is provided by ESA. Due to license restrictions, HR Image Mosaic 2009 is only available as a web service (WMS), and not for data download.",
