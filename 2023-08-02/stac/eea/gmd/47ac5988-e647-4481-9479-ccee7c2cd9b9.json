  "description": "The Copernicus SAR Wet Snow (SWS) product is generated in near real-time for the entire EEA38 and the United Kingdom, based on radar satellite data from the Sentinel-1 constellation. The product provides binary information on the wet snow extent and the snow free or patchy snow or dry snow extent in high mountain areas with a spatial resolution of 60 m x 60 m. \n\nThe SWS product is distributed in raster files covering an area of 110 km by 110 km with a pixel size of 60 m by 60 m in UTM/WGS84 projection, which corresponds to the Sentinel-2 input L1C product tile. It is available in several mountainous regions in Iceland, the Pyrenees, the Alps, Eastern Türkiye and Scandinavia. Each product is composed of two separate GeoTIFF files corresponding to the different layers of the product, and a metadata file.The WSM (Wet Snow classification in high Mountainous areas) layer provides the wet snow extent derived from S1 Level 1 GRD data over high montainous areas, and the QCWSM (Quality) layer provides the per-pixel accuracy information associated with the WSM layer for all pixels with detected snow areas. \n\nThe SWS is one of the products of the pan-European High-Resolution Snow & Ice service (HR-S&I), which are provided at high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m and 60 m x 60 m), from the Sentinel-2  and Sentinel-1 constellations data from September 1, 2016 onwards. Visit https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring to get more information on the different HR-S&I products (Snow products : FSC, WDS, SWS, GFSC, and PSA. Ice products: RLIE and ARLIE).",
