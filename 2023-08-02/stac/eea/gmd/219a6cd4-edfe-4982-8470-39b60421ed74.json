  "description": "The Copernicus Aggregated River and Lake Ice Extent (ARLIE) product is a spatially aggregated information on surface water conditions of rivers and lakes. ARLIE information is stored in a geodatabase, enriched every day from the River and Lake Ice extent products (RLIE S1, RLIE S2 and RLIE S1+S2) for the entire EEA38 and the United Kingdom. It provides percent coverage of snow-covered or snow-free ice on lakes and on 10 km river sections described by the EU-HYDRO river and lake network database. \n\nThe ARLIE products are stored in a PostGIS persistent geodatabase. They can be retrieved by using a specific REST API. Users can query ice sheet summary information of river segments and lakes (ARLIE statistics) together with the geometry and caracteristics of the features on which these statistics were estimated. All geometry features are delivered in the ETRS89 LAEA (EPSG:3035) coordinate reference system. \n \nARLIE is one of the products of the pan-European High-Resolution Snow & Ice service (HR-S&I), which are provided at high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m and 60 m x 60 m) from the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 constellations data from September 1, 2016 onwards. \n\nVisit https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring to get more information on the different HR-S&I products (Snow products : FSC, WDS, SWS, GFSC, and PSA. Ice products : RLIE and ARLIE)",
