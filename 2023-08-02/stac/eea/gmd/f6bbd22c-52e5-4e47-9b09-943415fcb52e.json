  "description": "The Copernicus High Resolution Layer Water and Wetness (WAW) 2018 is a thematic product showing the occurrence of water and wet surfaces over the period from 2012 to 2018 for the EEA38 area and the United Kingdom. This metadata refers to the 100 meter aggregate raster, provided as a full EEA38 and United Kingdom mosaic (fully conformant to with the EEA reference grid). The production of the High Resolution Water and Wetness layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme\n\nTwo Water and Wetness products are available:\n- The main Water and Wetness (WAW) product, with defined classes of (1) permanent water, (2) temporary water, (3) permanent wetness and (4) temporary wetness.\n- The additional expert product: Water and Wetness Probability Index (WWPI).\nThe products show the occurrence of water and indicate the degree of wetness in a physical sense, assessed independently of the actual vegetation cover and are thus not limited to a specific land cover class and their relative frequencies.",
