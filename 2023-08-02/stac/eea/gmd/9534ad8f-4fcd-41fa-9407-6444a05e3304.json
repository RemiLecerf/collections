  "description": "The pan-European High Resolution (HR) Image Mosaic 2015 provides up to two cloud-free HR optical coverage 1 of EEA39 countries including all islands of those countries plus French Overseas Departments (DOMs) acquired within predefined windows corresponding to the vegetation season in 2014-2015.\n\nImages are derived from the following satellite sensors:\n\nResourcesat-1/2\nSPOT-5\nSentinel-2 MSI\n\nThe mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.\n\nThe input imagery for the creation of the mosaic is provided by ESA. Due to license restrictions, HR Image Mosaic 2015 is only available as a web service (WMS), and not for data download.",
