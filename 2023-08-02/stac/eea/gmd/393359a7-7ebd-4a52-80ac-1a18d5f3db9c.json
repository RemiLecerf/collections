  "description": "EU-Hydro is a dataset for all EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom providing photo-interpreted river network, consistent of surface interpretation of water bodies (lakes and wide rivers), and a drainage model (also called Drainage Network), derived from EU-DEM, with catchments and drainage lines and nodes. \nThe EU-Hydro dataset is distributed in separate files (river network and drainage network) for each of the 35 major basins of the EEA38 + UK area, in GDB and GPKG formats. \nThe production of EU-Hydro and the derived layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.",
