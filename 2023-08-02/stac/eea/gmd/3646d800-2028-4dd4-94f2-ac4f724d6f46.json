  "description": "The pan-European High Resolution (HR) Image Mosaic 2006 provides HR2 (High Resolution: 20 meter) coverage over Europe for the continuation of Corine Land Cover like exercises and for the generation of HR layers by the EU and EEA.\n\nThe surface covered by the image dataset is 5.8 million square kilometres and has a spatial resolution of 20 meters. The imagery is composed during specific acquisition windows in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Coverage 2 acquisitions are expected to be 6 weeks away from Coverage 1, down to a minimum of 2 weeks for northern countries, including United Kingdom. The Â± 6 weeks criteria might not be strictly applied over Atlantic Islands and French DOMs (seasonal changes are limited in the equatorial DOMs). Images are derived from the following satellite sensors:\n\nRapidEye constellation\n\nThe mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.\n\nThe input imagery for the creation of the mosaic is provided by ESA. Due to license restrictions, HR Image Mosaic 2006 is only available as a web service (WMS), and not for data download.",
