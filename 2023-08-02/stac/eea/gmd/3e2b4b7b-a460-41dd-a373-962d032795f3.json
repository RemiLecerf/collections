  "description": "The Copernicus Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) product is generated in near real-time for the entire EEA38 and the United Kingdom, based on optical satellite data from the Sentinel-2 constellation. The product provides the fraction of the surface covered by snow at the top of canopy (FSC-TOC) and on ground (FSC-OG) per pixel as a percentage (0% â€“ 100%) with a spatial resolution of 20 m x 20 m.\nFSC is one of the products of the pan-European High-Resolution Snow & Ice service (HR-S&I), which are provided at high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m and 60 m x 60 m), from the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 constellations data from September 1, 2016 onwards. Visit https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring to get more information on the different HR-S&I products (Snow products : FSC, WDS, SWS, GFSC, and PSA. Ice products : RLIE and ARLIE)\nThe FSC product is distributed in raster files covering an area of 110 km by 110 km with a pixel size of 20 m by 20 m in UTM/WGS84 projection, which corresponds to the Sentinel-2 input L1C product tile. Each product is composed of seven separate files corresponding to the different layers of the product, and another metadata file.",
