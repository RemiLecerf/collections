  "description": "EU-DEM v1.0 is a digital surface model (DSM) representing the first surface as illuminated by the sensors. It is a hybrid product based on SRTM and ASTER GDEM data fused by a weighted averaging approach and generated as a contiguous dataset divided into 1 degree by 1 degree tiles, corresponding to the SRTM naming convention. The spatial reference system is geographic, lat/lon with horizontal datum ETRS89, ellipsoid GRS80 and vertical datum EVRS2000 with geoid EGG08. These tiles have then been aggregated into 5°x5° tiles which have been projected to ETRS-LAEA by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission.\n\nThe implementation of EU-DEM v1.0 was coordinated by the European Commission in 2009-2011 in the framework of the Reference Data Access (RDA) Action of the EU GMES/Copernicus programme.",
