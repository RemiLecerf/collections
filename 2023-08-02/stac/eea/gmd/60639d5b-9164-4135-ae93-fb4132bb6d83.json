  "description": "The High Resolution Layer (HRL) Grassland 2018 raster product provides a basic land cover classification with 2 thematic classes (grassland / non-grassland) at 10m spatial resolution, covering the EEA38 area and the United Kingdom. The production of the High Resolution grassland layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.\n\nThis is the main High Resolution grassland product. This grassy and non-woody vegetation baseline product includes all kinds of grasslands: managed grassland, semi-natural grassland and natural grassy vegetation. It is a binary status layer for the 2015 reference year mapping grassland and all non-grassland areas in 20m and (aggregated) 100m pixel size and, for the 2018 reference year, in 10m and (aggregated) 100m pixel size.\n\nThe dataset for this product is provided as 10 meter rasters in 100 x 100 km tiles (fully conformant with EEA reference grid) grouped according to the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom.",
