  "description": "Vegetation Indices (VI) product is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS), pan-European High Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity [(HR-VPP)](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-vegetation-phenology-and-productivity) product suite.\nThe product is comprised of 4 raw Vegetation Indices; (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (2) Leaf Area Index (LAI),\n(3) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and (4) Plant Phenology Index (PPI) generated near real-time (NRT) from Sentinel-2 satellite observations.\nThe raw Vegetation Indices are provided on a daily basis at 10m resolution from October 2016 onwards. Therefore, VI products are available over the EEA39 region for the respective observation day\nbased on 5-day revisit period of Sentinel-2. The VIs are accompanied by a related QFLAG2 band that flags clouds, shadows, snow, open water and other areas where the VI retrieval is less reliable.\nMore information about raw vegetation indices is outlined in the [product user manual](https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/product-user-manual-of-vegetation-indices/)\n",
