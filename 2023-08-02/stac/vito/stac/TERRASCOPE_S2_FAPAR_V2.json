  "description": "FAPAR Level-3 product at 10m resolution. Covers selected areas globally. This FAPAR is derived directly from ESA L2A products. The FAPAR quantifies the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed by live leaves for the photosynthesis activity. Then, it refers only to the green and alive elements of the canopy. The FAPAR depends on the canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties, atmospheric conditions, and angular configuration. \n\nFAPAR is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).",
