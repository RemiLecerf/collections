  "description": "The VGT-S10 are near-global, 10-daily composite images which are synthesised from the 'best available' observations registered in the course of every 'dekad' by the orbiting earth observation system SPOT-VEGETATION. The products provide data from all spectral bands (SWIR, NIR, RED, BLUE), the NDVI and auxiliary data on image acquisition parameters. The VEGETATION system allows operational and near real-time applications, at global, continental and regional scales, in very broad environmentally and socio-economically critical fields. The VEGETATION instrument is operational since April 1998, first with VGT1, from March 2003 onwards, with VGT2.
