  "description": "The Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA) is a comprehensive dataset\nof soil attributes across Australia at 3 arc-second resolution (~90m\npixels). The surfaces are the outcomes from modelling that describe the\nspatial distribution of the soil attributes using existing soil data and\nenvironmental covariates. See [Viscarra Rossel et al (2015)](https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR14366)\nfor further details. The SLGA can be used in studies of vadose zone\nprocesses, including solute transport, groundwater and nutrient fluxes\nbeyond the root zone, as well as a wide spectrum of ecological,\nhydrological, and broader environmental applications.\n\nEach product contains six digital soil attribute maps and their upper and\nlower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths:\n0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, and 100-200cm. These depths and\nsoil attributes are consistent with the specifications of\n[GlobalSoilMap](https://www.isric.org/projects/globalsoilmapnet).\n\nThis collection has 12 images. Ten of them contain data for GSM primary\nsoil attributes; the other two contain regolith depth and soil depth GSM\nattributes.\n\n| Attribute                              | Description                                                                                                                   | Code | # of Bands |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------------|\n| Bulk Density (whole earth)             | Bulk density of the whole soil (including coarse fragments) in mass per unit volume by a method equivalent to the core method | BDW  | 18         |\n| Organic Carbon                         | Mass fraction of carbon by weight in the < 2mm soil material as determined by dry combustion at 900 Celsius                   | SOC  | 18         |\n| Clay                                   | < 2&micro;m mass fraction of the <2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                       | CLY  | 18         |\n| Silt                                   | 2-20&micro;m mass fraction of the < 2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                     | SLT  | 18         |\n| Sand                                   | 20&micro;m - 2mm mass fraction of the < 2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                 | SND  | 18         |\n| pH (CaCl2)                             | pH of 1:5 soil/0.01M calcium chloride extract                                                                                 | pHc  | 18         |\n| Available Water Capacity               | Available water capacity computed for each of the specified depth increments                                                  | AWC  | 18         |\n| Total Nitrogen                         | Mass fraction of total nitrogen in the soil by weight                                                                         | NTO  | 18         |\n| Total Phosphorus                       | Mass fraction of total phosphorus in the soil by weight                                                                       | PTO  | 18         |\n| Effective Cation Exchange Capacity     | Cations extracted using barium chloride (BaCl2) plus exchangeable H + Al                                                      | ECE  | 18         |\n| Depth of Regolith                      | Depth to hard rock.
