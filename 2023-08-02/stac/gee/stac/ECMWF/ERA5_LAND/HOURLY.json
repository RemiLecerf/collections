  "description": "ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the\nevolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution\ncompared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land\ncomponent of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model\ndata with observations from across the world into a globally complete and\nconsistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that\ngoes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the\nclimate of the past. This dataset includes all 50 variables as available on\nCDS.\n\nPlease note that the convention for accumulations used in ERA5-Land differs\nwith that for ERA5. The accumulations are treated the same as those in\nERA-Interim or ERA-Interim/Land, i.e., they are accumulated from the\nbeginning of the forecast to the end of the forecast step. This happens\nwithin every day and gets reset on midnight. The Earth Engine Data team\nadded 19 additional bands,\none for each of the accumulation bands, with the hourly values computed as\nthe difference between two consecutive forecast steps.\n\nERA5-Land data is available from 1981 to three months from real-time. More\ninformation can be found at the\n[Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).\n",
