  "description": "ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the\nevolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution\ncompared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land\ncomponent of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model\ndata with observations from across the world into a globally complete and\nconsistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that\ngoes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the\nclimate of the past. This dataset includes all 50 variables as available on\nCDS.\n\nThe data presented here is a subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset\npost-processed by ECMWF. Monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated to\nfacilitate many applications requiring easy and fast access to the data,\nwhen sub-monthly fields are not required.\n\nERA5-Land data is available from 1981 to three months from real-time. More\ninformation can be found at the [Copernicus Climate Data Store]\n(https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).\n",
