  "description": "This dataset contains annual, summertime, and wintertime surface urban\nheat island (SUHI) intensities for day and night for over 10,000 urban clusters\nthroughout the world. The dataset was created using the MODIS 8-day TERRA and\nAQUA land surface temperature (LST) products, the Landscan urban extent\ndatabase, the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010, and the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover data\nusing the Simplified Urban-Extent Algorithm. The product is available both at\nthe pixel level (at 300 m resolution after downscaling) and as urban cluster\nmeans from 2003 to 2018. The monthly composites are only available as urban\ncluster means.\n\nA summary of older versions,\nincluding changes from the dataset created and analyzed in the originally\npublished manuscript can be found on the\n[Yale Center for Earth Observation website](https://yceo.yale.edu/research/global-surface-uhi-explorer).\nThe dataset can also be explored using the [Global Surface UHI\nExplorer web application](https://yceo.users.earthengine.app/view/uhimap).\n\nThe dataset is split into the following six components:\n\n1. **UHI_all_averaged:** Image containing cluster-mean\ncomposite daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity for annual, summer,\nand winter.\n\n2. **UHI_monthly_averaged:** Image containing cluster-mean\nmonthly composites of daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity.\n\n3. **UHI_yearly_averaged:** Image collection of cluster-mean\nyearly composites of daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity from 2003.\nto 2018.\n\n4. **UHI_yearly_pixel:** Image collection of spatially\ndisaggregated (nominal scale of 300 m) annual daytime and nighttime\nSUHI intensity from 2003 to 2018.\n\n5. **Summer_UHI_yearly_pixel:** Image collection of spatially\ndisaggregated (nominal scale of 300 m) summertime daytime and\nnighttime SUHI intensity from 2003 to 2018.\n\n6. **Winter_UHI_yearly_pixel:** Image collection of spatially\ndisaggregated (nominal scale of 300 m) wintertime daytime and\nnighttime SUHI intensity from 2003 to 2018.\n\nThis asset is the second component.\n",
