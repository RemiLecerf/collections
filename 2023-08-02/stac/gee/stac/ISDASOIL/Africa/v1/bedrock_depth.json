  "description": "Depth to bedrock at 0-200 cm depth, predicted mean and standard deviation.\n\nDue to the potential cropland mask that was used for generating the data,\nmany areas of exposed rock (where depth to bedrock would be 0 cm) have been\nmasked out and therefore appear as nodata values. The maximum depth of this\nlayer is 200 cm, but this does not represent the maximum possible soil depth,\ntherefore values of 200 should be interpreted as >= 200.\n\nIn areas of dense jungle (generally over central Africa), model accuracy is\nlow and therefore artifacts such as banding (striping) might be seen.\n\nSoil property predictions were made by\n[Innovative Solutions for Decision Agriculture Ltd. (iSDA)](https://isda-africa.com/)\nat 30 m pixel size using machine learning coupled with remote sensing data\nand a training set of over 100,000 analyzed soil samples.\n\nFurther information can be found in the\n[FAQ](https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil/faq/) and\n[technical information documentation](https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil/technical-information/).
