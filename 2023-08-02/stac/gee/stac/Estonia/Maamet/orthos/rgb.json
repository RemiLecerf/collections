  "description": "Orthophotos are an aerial photo dataset covering Estonia.\n\nAn orthophoto is a processed aerial photo from which distortions caused\nby terrain relief, camera tilt relative to the ground at the moment of\nexposure and camera central projection are removed. A digital orthophoto\nhas a certain pixel size or resolution which shows the smallest\nindivisible exposed area on the ground (Ground Sampling Distance, GSD).\n\nOrthophotos have a nationwide coverage and correspond to the scale of\n1:5000-1:10000 (pixel size 20-40 cm). Orthophotos for densely populated\nareas are produced with the pixel size of 10-16 cm.\n\nThe RGB dataset has three bands: red, green, and blue.\n\nFor more information, please see the [Estonia orthophotos documentation]\n(https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Spatial-Data/Orthophotos-p309.html)\n",
