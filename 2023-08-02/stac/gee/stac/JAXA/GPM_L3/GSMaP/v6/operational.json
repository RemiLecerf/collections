  "description": "Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) provides\na global hourly rain rate with a 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution. GSMaP\nis a product of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission,\nwhich provides global precipitation observations at three hour\nintervals.  Values are estimated using multi-band passive microwave\nand infrared radiometers from the GPM Core Observatory satellite\nand with the assistance of a constellation of other satellites.  GPM's\nprecipitation rate retrieval algorithm is based on a radiative\ntransfer model. The gauge-adjusted rate is calculated based on\nthe optimization of the 24h accumulation of GSMaP hourly rain rate\nto daily precipitation by NOAA/CPC gauge measurement. This dataset\nis processed by GSMaP algorithm version 6 (product version 3).\nSee [GSMaP Technical Documentation](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/doc/algorithm/GSMaPforGPM_20140902_E.pdf)\nfor more details.\n\nThis dataset contains provisional products GSMaP_NRT that are\nregularly replaced with updated versions when the GSMaP_MVK data\nbecome available.\nThe products are marked with a metadata property called ''status''.\nWhen a product is initially made available, the property value\nis ''provisional''. Once a provisional product has been updated\nwith the final version, this value is updated to ''permanent''.\n\nGSMaP for the reanalysis data (from 2000 to 2014) is also provided\nin the [GPM RNL collection][JAXA_GPM_L3_GSMaP_v6_reanalysis].\n",
