  "description": "The global forest/non-forest map (FNF) is generated by\nclassifying the SAR image (backscattering coefficient) in the\nglobal 25m resolution PALSAR-2/PALSAR SAR mosaic so that strong and\nlow backscatter pixels are assigned as \\\"forest\\\" and \\\"non-forest\\\",\nrespectively. Here, \\\"forest\\\" is defined as the natural forest\nwith the area larger than 0.5 ha and forest cover over 10%. This\ndefinition is the same as the Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO) definition. Since the radar backscatter from the forest\ndepends on the region (climate zone), the classification of\nForest/Non-Forest is conducted by using a region-dependent\nthreshold of backscatter. The classification accuracy is\nchecked by using in-situ photos and high-resolution optical\nsatellite images.\n\nDetailed information:\n\n*   [2017 - 2020](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/pdf/DatasetDescription_PALSAR2_FNF_v200a.pdf)\n\nAttention:\n\n*   Backscatter values may vary significantly from path to path\n    over high latitude forest areas. This is due to the change of\n    backscattering intensity caused by freezing trees in winter.\n    Please note that this may affect the classification of\n    forest/non-forest.\n",
