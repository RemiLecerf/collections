  "description": "This product is the sum of the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area.\n\nA newer version [JAXA/GCOM-C/L3/LAND/LAI/V3](JAXA_GCOM-C_L3_LAND_LAI_V3) is also available\nfor this dataset which uses this [algorithm](https://suzaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GCOM_C/data/product_std.html)\nfor processing.\n\nGCOM-C conducts long-term and continuous global observation and data collection to elucidate the\nmechanism behind fluctuations in radiation budget and carbon cycle needed to make accurate\nprojections regarding future temperature rise. At the same time, cooperating with research\ninstitutions having a climate numerical model, it contributes to reduction of errors in\ntemperature rise prediction derived from the climate numerical model and improvement of accuracy\nof prediction of various environmental changes. SGLI mounted on GCOM-C is the succession sensor\nof the Global Imager (GLI) mounted on ADEOS-II (MIDORI II) and is the Imaging Radiometer which\nmeasures the radiation from near-ultraviolet to thermal infrared region (380 nm-12 um) in 19\nchannels. Global observation of once for approximately every two days is possible at\nmid-latitude near Japan by observation width at ground greater than 1,000 km. In addition, SGLI\nrealizes high resolution than the similar global sensor and has a polarized observation function\nand a multi-angle observation function.\n",
