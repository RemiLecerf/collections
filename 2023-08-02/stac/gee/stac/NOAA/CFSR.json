  "description": "The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast\nSystem Reanalysis (CFSR) was designed and executed as a global,\nhigh-resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea ice system to\nprovide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over the\n32-year period of record from January 1979 to March 2011. It has been\nextended as an operational real-time product. The data in Earth Engine are\nonly present starting from December 13, 2018.\n\nForecasts are initialized four times per day (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800\nUTC). We ingest only a subset of bands from files matching\n`cdas1.t??z.pgrbh**03|00**.grib2`, i.e. files of only 0-hour and 3-hour\nforecasts as the others are omitted. The forecast length is indicated by the\n'forecast_hour' metadata field.\n\nSome images contain only a subset of bands. Using this dataset with both\n\"00\" and \"03\" forecast types will require you to cast the bands across\nthe collection.\n",
