  "description": "The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced by\nthe National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The GFS dataset\nconsists of selected model outputs (described below) as gridded forecast\nvariables. The 384-hour forecasts, with 1-hour (up to 120 hours)\nand 3-hour (after 120 hours) forecast intervals,\nare made at 6-hour temporal resolution (i.e. updated four times daily).\nUse the 'creation_time' and 'forecast_time' properties to select data of\ninterest.\n\nThe GFS is a coupled model, composed of an atmosphere model, an ocean model,\na land/soil model, and a sea ice model which work together to provide an\naccurate picture of weather conditions. See\n[history of recent modifications to the global forecast/analysis system\n](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/STATS/html/model_changes.html)\nand the\n[documentation](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/txt_descriptions/GFS_doc.shtml)\nfor more information.\n",
