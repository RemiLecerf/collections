  "description": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Leaf Area Index (LAI)\nand Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) Version 1 data\nproduct provides information about the vegetative canopy layer at 500 meter\nresolution (VNP15A2H). The VIIRS sensor is located onboard the NOAA/NASA\njoint Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. LAI\nis an index that quantifies the one-sided leaf area of a canopy, while FPAR\nis the fraction of incoming solar energy absorbed through photosynthesis at\n400 to 700 nanometers. This product is intentionally designed after the\nTerra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\nLAI/FPAR operational algorithm to promote the continuity of the Earth\nObservation System (EOS) mission.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/126/VNP15_User_Guide.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/125/VNP15_ATBD.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/vnp15a2hv001/)\n\n* [Land Product Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/NPP_QA/)\n",
