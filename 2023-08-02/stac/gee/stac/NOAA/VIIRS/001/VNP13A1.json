  "description": "The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) NASA Visible\nInfrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Vegetation Indices (VNP13A1)\ndata product provides vegetation indices by a process of\nselecting the best available pixel over a 16-day acquisition period\nat 500 meter resolution. The VNP13 data products are designed\nafter the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\nTerra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the\ncontinuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\n\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: (1)\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (2) the Enhanced\nVegetation Index (EVI), and (3) Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2).\n(1) NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series\nobservations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands.\n(2) EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive\nto canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. (3) EVI2\nis a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and\nNIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing\nVIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2\nwill eventually become the standard EVI.\n\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also\nincludes layers for near-infrared (NIR) reflectance; three shortwave\ninfrared (SWIR) reflectance-red, blue, and green reflectance; composite\nday of year; pixel reliability; view and sun angles, and a quality layer.\n\nFor additional information, visit the VIIRS [Land Product Quality\nAssessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/NPP_QA/) and see\nthe [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/184/VNP13_User_Guide_ATBD_V2.1.2.pdf).\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/184/VNP13_User_Guide_ATBD_V2.1.2.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/184/VNP13_User_Guide_ATBD_V2.1.2.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/filespec/VIIRS/1/VNP13A1)\n",
