  "description": "The NASA Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible\nInfrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Surface Temperature and\nEmissivity (LST&E) Day Version 1 product (VNP21A1D) is compiled daily\nfrom daytime Level 2 Gridded (L2G) intermediate products.\n\nThe L2G process maps the daily VNP21 swath granules onto a sinusoidal MODIS\ngrid and stores all observations overlapping a gridded cell for a given\nday. The VNP21A1 algorithm sorts through all these observations for each\ncell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all cloud-free\nobservations that have good LST accuracies. Only observations having\nobservation coverage more than a certain threshold (15%) are considered for\nthis averaging.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/429/VNP21_User_Guide_V1.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1332/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/vnp21a1dv001/)\n\n* [Land Product Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/NPP_QA/)\n",
