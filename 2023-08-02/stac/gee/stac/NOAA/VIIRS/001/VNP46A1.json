  "description": "The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared\nImaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) supports a Day-Night Band (DNB) sensor\nthat provides global daily measurements of nocturnal visible and\nnear-infrared (NIR) light that are suitable for Earth system science and\napplications. The VIIRS DNB's ultra-sensitivity in lowlight conditions\nenables us to generate a new set of science-quality nighttime products that\nmanifest substantial improvements in sensor resolution and calibration when\ncompared to the previous era of Defense Meteorological Satellite\nProgram/Operational Linescan System's (DMSP/OLS) nighttime lights image\nproducts.\n\nVNP46A1 is a daily, top-of-atmosphere, at-sensor nighttime radiance product\ncalled VIIRS/NPP Daily Gridded Day Night Band 15 arc-second Linear Lat Lon\nGrid Night. The product contains 26 Science Data Sets (SDS) that include\nsensor radiance, zenith and azimuth angles (at-sensor, solar, and lunar),\ncloud-mask flags, time, shortwave IR radiance, brightness temperatures,\nVIIRS quality flags, moon phase angle, and moon illumination fraction. It\nalso provides Quality Flag (QF) information specific to the cloud-mask,\nVIIRS moderate-resolution bands M10, M11, M12, M13, M15, M16, and DNB.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/v2/content/archives/Document%20Archive/Science%20Data%20Product%20Documentation/VIIRS_Black_Marble_UG_v1.1_July_2020.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/v2/content/archives/Document%20Archive/Science%20Data%20Product%20Documentation/Product%20Generation%20Algorithms/VIIRS_Black_Marble_ATBD_v1.1_July_2020.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/VNP46A1/)\n",
