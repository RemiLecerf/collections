For this purpose, over 2,500\nSentinel-1 and over 11,000 Sentinel-2 images were processed to produce a single\nmosaic dataset for the year 2017. Then, an object-based Random Forest\nclassification method was trained by a large number of reference samples for 13\nclasses to generate the Iran-wide land cover map.\n",
