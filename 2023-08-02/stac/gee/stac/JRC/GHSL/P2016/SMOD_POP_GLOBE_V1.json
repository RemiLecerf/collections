  "description": "The GHSL relies on the design and implementation of new spatial data mining\ntechnologies allowing to automatically process and extract analytics and\nknowledge from large amount of heterogeneous data including: global,\nfine-scale satellite image data streams, census data, and crowd sources or\nvolunteered geographic information sources.\n\nThe GHS-SMOD is the rural-urban Settlement classification MODel adopted by\nthe GHSL. It is the representation of the degree of urbanization\n([DEGURBA](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/degree-of-urbanisation/background))\nconcept into the GHSL data scenario. Each grid in the GHS-SMOD has been\ngenerated by integrating the GHSL built-up areas and GHSL population grids\ndata for reference epochs: 1975, 1990, 2000, 2015.\n\nThe DEGURBA classification schema is a people-based definition of cities and\nsettlements: it operates using as main input a 1 kmÂ² grid cell accounting\nfor population at a given point in time. The DEGURBA discriminates the\npopulation grid cells in three main classes: '[urban centers](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)'\n(cities), '[urban clusters](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_cluster)'\n(towns and suburbs), and '[rural grid cells](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Rural_grid_cell)'.\n(base). These class abstractions translate to 'high density clusters (HDC)',\n'low density clusters (LDC)', and 'rural grid cells (RUR)', respectively,\nin the GHS-SMOD implementation.\n\nThe 'HDC' differ from the DEGURBA '[urban centers](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)'\nin that they account for the over-fragmentation of cities in regions\nwith large low-density residential development by integrating the\nbuilt-up layer. In the GHS-SMOD representation, the 'HDC' are the spatial\ngeneralization of contiguous population grid cells (4-connectivity,\ngap-filling) with a density of at least 1500 inhabitants per kmÂ² or a\ndensity of built-up surface > 50%, and a minimum total resident population\nof 50000. The 'LDC' are continuous grid cells with a density of at least 300\ninhabitants per kmÂ² and a minimum total population of 5000. The 'RUR' are\ngrid cells outside 'HDC' and 'LDC' with population > 0 and < 300. Everything\nelse is classified as inhabited areas where population = 0.\n\nThis dataset was produced in the World Mollweide projection (EPSG:54009).\n\nFor more information visit: [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod.php](http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod.php).\n\nThe Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project is supported by the\nEuropean Commission, Joint Research Center, and Directorate-General for\nRegional and Urban Policy. The GHSL produces new global spatial information,\nevidence-based analytics, and knowledge describing the human presence in\nthe planet.\n",
