  "description": "This dataset contains maps of the location and temporal\ndistribution of surface water from 1984 to 2015 and provides\nstatistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces.\nFor more information see the associated journal article: [High-resolution\nmapping of global surface water and its long-term changes](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7633/full/nature20584.html)\n(Nature, 2016) and the online [Data Users Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2.pdf).\n\nThese data were generated using 3,066,102 scenes from Landsat\n5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 10 October 2015.\nEach pixel was individually classified into water / non-water\nusing an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly\nhistory for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999,\n2000-2015) for change detection.\n\nThe Monthly Recurrence collection contains 12 images: monthly measures of\nthe seasonality of water based on the occurrence values detected in that\nmonth over all years.\n",
