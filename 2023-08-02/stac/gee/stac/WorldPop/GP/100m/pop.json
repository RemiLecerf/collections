  "description": "Global high-resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are\na prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population\ngrowth, for monitoring changes, and for planning interventions. The WorldPop\nproject aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open\naccess population distribution datasets built using transparent and\npeer-reviewed approaches.\n\nFull details on the methods and datasets used in constructing the\ndata, along with open access publications, are provided on the\n[WorldPop website](https://www.worldpop.org/). In brief, recent census-based\npopulation counts matched to their associated administrative units are\ndisaggregated to ~100x100m grid cells through machine learning approaches\nthat exploit the relationships between population densities and a range of\ngeospatial covariate layers. The mapping approach\nis Random Forest-based dasymetric redistribution.\n\nThis dataset depict estimated number of people\nresiding in each grid cell in 2010, 2015, and other years.\n\nFor 2020, the breakdown of population by age and sex is available in\nthe [WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex](WorldPop_GP_100m_pop_age_sex)\nand [WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj](WorldPop_GP_100m_pop_age_sex_cons_unadj)\ncollections.\n\nFurther WorldPop gridded datasets on population age structures,\npoverty, urban growth, and population dynamics are freely available on\nthe WorldPop website. WorldPop represents a collaboration between\nresearchers at the University of Southampton, Universite Libre de\nBruxelles, and University of Louisville. The project is principally funded by\nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",
