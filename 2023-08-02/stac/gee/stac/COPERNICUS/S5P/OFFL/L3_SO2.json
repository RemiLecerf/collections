  "description": "### OFFL/L3_SO2\n\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of atmospheric sulfur\ndioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) enters the Earth's atmosphere through both natural and\nanthropogenic processes. It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global\nscale and its impact ranges from short-term pollution to effects on climate.\nOnly about 30% of the emitted SO<sub>2</sub> comes from natural sources; the majority\nis of anthropogenic origin. SO<sub>2</sub> emissions adversely affect human health and\nair quality. SO<sub>2</sub> has an effect on climate through radiative forcing, via\nthe formation of sulfate aerosols. Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions can also pose a\nthreat to aviation, along with volcanic ash. S5P/TROPOMI samples the Earth's\nsurface with a revisit time of one day with unprecedented spatial resolution\nof 3.5 x 7 km which allows the resolution of fine details including the\ndetection of much smaller SO<sub>2</sub> plumes. [[More information](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/sulphur-dioxide)]\n\nFor this L3 SO<sub>2</sub> product, the absorbing_aerosol_index is calculated with a\npair of measurements at the 340 nm and 380 wavelengths.  The\n[COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_AER_AI](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S5P_OFFL_L3_AER_AI)\nproduct has the absorbing_aerosol_index calculated using the 354 nm and 388\nnm wavelengths.\n\n### OFFL L3 Product\n\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find areas within the product's bounding\nbox with data using a command like this:\n\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'SO2_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__SO2____20181228T231131_20181229T005301_06265_01_010105_20190104T083244.nc\ngrid_info.h5\n```\n\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (area-averaging values for\npixels that may have different values for different times).  From the\nmosaic, we create a set of tiles containing orthorectified raster data.\n\nThe qa value is adjusted before running harpconvert to satisfy all of the\nfollowing criteria:\n\n* snow_ice < 0.5\n* sulfurdioxide_total_air_mass_factor_polluted > 0.1\n* sulfurdioxide_total_vertical_column > -0.001\n* qa_value > 0.5\n* cloud_fraction_crb < 0.3\n* solar_zenith_angle < 60\n\nThe 15km SO2 band is ingested only when solar_zenith_angle < 70.\n\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'SO2_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time});\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\nkeep(SO2_column_number_density,SO2_column_number_density_amf,\n     SO2_slant_column_number_density,absorbing_aerosol_index,cloud_fraction, sensor_altitude,\n     sensor_azimuth_angle, sensor_zenith_angle,solar_azimuth_angle,\n     solar_zenith_angle)'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__SO2____20181228T231131_20181229T005301_06265_01_010105_20190104T083244.nc\noutput.h5\n```\n\n### Sentinel-5 Precursor\n\nSentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017\nby the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution.  The onboard sensor\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\n\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near \nReal-Time (NRTI) and Offline (OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. \nThe NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL assets, but appear more \nquickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data from a single orbit \n(which, due to half the earth being dark, contains data only for a single \nhemisphere).\n\nBecause of noise on the data, negative vertical column values are often\nobserved in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions. It is\nrecommended not to filter these values except for outliers, i.e.\nfor vertical columns lower than -0.001 mol/m^2.\n\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\nis performed).\n\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\n\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\nremove pixels with QA values less than:\n\n*  80% for AER_AI\n*  75% for the tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density band of NO2\n*  50% for all other datasets except for O3 and SO2\n\nThe O3_TCL product is ingested directly (without running harpconvert).\n",
