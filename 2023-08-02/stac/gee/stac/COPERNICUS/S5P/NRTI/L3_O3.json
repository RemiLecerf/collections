  "description": "### NRTI/L3_O3\n\nThis dataset provides near-real-time high-resolution imagery of total\ncolumn ozone concentrations. See also `COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_O3_TCL`\nfor the tropospheric column data.\n\nIn the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous\nsolar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient\ncleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the\nhealth of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important\ngreenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change. Since the discovery\nof the Antarctic ozone hole in the 1980s and the subsequent Montreal Protocol\nregulating the production of chlorine-containing ozone-depleting substances,\nozone has been routinely monitored from the ground and from space.\n\nFor this product, there are two algorithms that deliver total ozone: GDP for\nthe near real-time and GODFIT for the offline products. GDP is currently\nbeing used for generating the operational total ozone products from GOME,\nSCIAMACHY and GOME-2; while GODFIT is being used in the ESA CCI and the\nCopernicus C3S projects.\n[More information](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/total-ozone-column).\n[Product user manual](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/2474726/Sentinel-5P-Level-2-Product-User-Manual-Ozone-Total-Column)\n\n### NRTI L3 Product\n\nTo make our NRTI L3 products, we use [harpconvert](https://stcorp.github.io/harp/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\nto grid the data.\n\nThe qa value is adjusted before running harpconvert to satisfy all of the\nfollowing criteria:\n\n* ozone_total_vertical_column in [0, 0.45]\n* ozone_effective_temperature in [180, 260]\n* fitted_root_mean_square > 0.01\n\nExample harpconvert invocation:\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'O3_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time});\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\nkeep(O3_column_number_density,O3_column_number_density_amf,\nO3_slant_column_number_density,O3_effective_temperature,cloud_fraction,\nsensor_azimuth_angle,sensor_zenith_angle,solar_azimuth_angle,\nsolar_zenith_angle)'\nS5P_NRTI_L2__O3_____20180710T230038_20180710T230538_03840_01_010000_20180711T005227.nc\noutput.h5\n```\n\n- Assets between the dates 2018-07-10 and 2018-07-18 are missing due to non-standard structure\nof product files.\n",
