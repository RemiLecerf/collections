  "description": "### NRTI/L3_CO\n\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of CO\nconcentrations.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric trace gas for understanding\ntropospheric chemistry. In certain urban areas, it is a major atmospheric\npollutant. Main sources of CO are combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning,\nand atmospheric oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons. Whereas fossil\nfuel combustion is the main source of CO at northern mid-latitudes, the oxidation\nof isoprene and biomass burning play an important role in the tropics. TROPOMI\non the Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) satellite observes the CO global abundance\nexploiting clear-sky and cloudy-sky Earth radiance measurements in the 2.3 &mu;m\nspectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the solar spectrum.\nTROPOMI clear sky observations provide CO total columns with sensitivity to the\ntropospheric boundary layer. For cloudy atmospheres, the column sensitivity\nchanges according to the light path. [[More information](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/carbon-monoxide)]\n\n### NRTI L3 Product\n\nTo make our NRTI L3 products, we use [harpconvert](https://stcorp.github.io/harp/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\nto grid the data.\n\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'CO_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time});\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\nkeep(CO_column_number_density,H2O_column_number_density,cloud_height,\nsensor_altitude,sensor_azimuth_angle, sensor_zenith_angle,\nsolar_azimuth_angle,solar_zenith_angle)'\nS5P_NRTI_L2__CO_____20181122T000018_20181122T000518_05741_01_010200_20181122T004844.nc\noutput.h5\n```\n\n### Sentinel-5 Precursor\n\nSentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017\nby the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution.  The onboard sensor\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\n\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near \nReal-Time (NRTI) and Offline (OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. \nThe NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL assets, but appear more \nquickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data from a single orbit \n(which, due to half the earth being dark, contains data only for a single \nhemisphere).\n\nBecause of noise on the data, negative vertical column values are often\nobserved in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions. It is\nrecommended not to filter these values except for outliers, i.e.\nfor vertical columns lower than -0.001 mol/m^2.\n\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\nis performed).\n\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\n\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\nremove pixels with QA values less than:\n\n*  80% for AER_AI\n*  75% for the tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density band of NO2\n*  50% for all other datasets except for O3 and SO2\n\nThe O3_TCL product is ingested directly (without running harpconvert).\n",
