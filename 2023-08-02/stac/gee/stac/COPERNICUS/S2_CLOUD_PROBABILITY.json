  "description": "The S2 cloud probability is created with the\n[sentinel2-cloud-detector](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector)\nlibrary (using [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM)).\nAll bands are upsampled using bilinear interpolation to 10m resolution\nbefore the gradient boost base algorithm is applied.  The resulting\n`0..1` floating point probability is scaled to `0..100` and stored as\na UINT8.  Areas missing any or all of the bands are masked out.\nHigher values are more likely to be clouds or highly reflective surfaces\n(e.g. roof tops or snow).\n\nSentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral\nimaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,\nincluding the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,\nas well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.\n\nThe Level-2 data can be found in the collection\n[COPERNICUS/S2_SR](COPERNICUS_S2_SR).  The Level-1B data can be found in the collection\n[COPERNICUS/S2](COPERNICUS_S2).  Additional metadata is available on assets in those\ncollections.\n\nSee\n[this tutorial](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/sentinel-2-s2cloudless)\nexplaining how to apply the cloud mask.\n",
