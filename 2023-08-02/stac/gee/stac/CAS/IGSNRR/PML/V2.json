  "description": "Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 (PML_V2) products include\nevapotranspiration (ET), its three components, and\ngross primary product (GPP) at 500m and 8-day resolution during 2002-2017\nand with spatial range from -60°S to 90°N. The major advantages of the\nPML_V2 products are:\n\n  1. coupled estimates of transpiration and GPP via canopy\n  conductance (Gan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019)\n  2. partitioning ET into three components: transpiration from vegetation,\n  direct evaporation from the soil and vaporization of intercepted\n   rainfall from vegetation (Zhang et al., 2016).\n\nThe PML_V2 products perform well against observations\nat 95 flux sites across globe, and are similar to or noticeably better than\nmajor state-of-the-art ET and GPP products widely used by water and ecology\nscience communities (Zhang et al., 2019).\n",
