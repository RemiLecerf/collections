  "description": "The MYD09Q1 product provides an estimate of the surface\nspectral reflectance of bands 1 and 2 at 250m resolution and corrected\nfor atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh\nscattering. Along with the two reflectance bands, a quality layer\nis also included. For each pixel, a value is selected from all\nthe acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high\nobservation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or\ncloud shadow, and aerosol loading.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/306/MOD09_User_Guide_V6.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/305/MOD09_ATBD.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/filespec/MODIS/6/MYD09Q1)\n",
