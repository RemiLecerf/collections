  "description": "The MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature and\nEmissivity (LST/E) product, MOD11A1, provides per-pixel temperature and\nemissivity values, which are produced daily using the generalized split-window\nLST algorithm.  This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of\natmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into\ntractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in bands 31 and 32 are estimated\nfrom land cover types.\n\nThe V5 MOD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the\nlevel-2 LST product (MOD11_L2) on 1-kilometer (precisely 0.928-km) grids. The\nMOD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for\ndaytime and nighttime observations:\n\n- LST_Day_1km: Daytime Land Surface Temperatures (K),  Scale 0.02\n- QC_Day: Daytime Surface Temperature quality control assessments\n- Day_view_time: Daytime LST Observation Times (Hours), Scale 0.1\n- Day_view_angle: Daytime View Zenith Angles (Degrees), Offset -65.0\n- LST_Night_1km: Nighttime Land Surface Temperatures (K),  Scale 0.02\n- QC_Night: Nighttime Surface Temperature quality control assessments\n- Night_view_time: Nighttime LST Observation Times (Hours), Scale 0.1\n- Night_view_angle: Nighttime View Zenith Angles (Degrees), Offset -65.0\n- Emis_31: Bands 31 Emissivity, Scale 0.002, Offset 0.49\n- Emis_32: Bands 32 Emissivity, Scale 0.002, Offset 0.49\n- Clear_night_cov: Nighttime Clear Sky Coverage, Scale 0.0005\n- Clear_day_cov: Daytime Clear Sky Coverage, Scale 0.0005\n\nQC bit flags:\n\n- Bits 0-1: Mandatory QC Flag\n   - 00: LST produced, good quality, not necessary to examine detailed QC.\n   - 01: LST produced, unreliable or unquantifiable quality, recommend examination of more detailed QC.\n   - 10: LST not produced due to cloud effects.\n   - 11: LST not produced primarily due to reasons other than clouds.\n- Bits 2-3: Data Quality Flag\n   - 00: Good quality L1B in bands 31 and 32.\n   - 01: Other quality data.\n   - 10: TBD\n   - 11: TBD\n- Bits 4-5: Emissivity Error Flag\n   - 00: Average emissivity error &le; 0.01\n   - 01: Average emissivity error &le; 0.02\n   - 10: Average emissivity error &le; 0.04\n   - 11: Average emissivity error &gt; 0.04\n- Bits 6-7: LST Error Flag\n   - 00: Average LST error &le; 1 K\n   - 01: Average LST error &le; 2 K\n   - 10: Average LST error &le; 3 K\n   - 11: Average LST error &gt; 3 K\n\nThe V5 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11A1, are validated to Stage-2\nthrough field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies.\n\nPlease visit [LP DAAC 'Citing Our Data' page](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/citing_our_data) for information on citing LP DAAC datasets.\n",
