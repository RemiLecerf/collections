  "description": "The level-3 MODIS global Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) and Emissivity 8-day data are composed from the\ndaily 1-kilometer LST product (MYD11A1) and stored on a 1-km\nSinusoidal grid as the average values of clear-sky LSTs during an\n8-day period.\n\nMYD11A2 is comprised of the following layers for daytime and nighttime\nobservations:\n\n- LST_Day_1km: Daytime Land Surface Temperatures (K),  Scale 0.02\n- QC_Day: Daytime Surface Temperature quality control assessments,\n      see QC bit flags\n- Day_view_time: Daytime LST Observation Times (Hours), Scale 0.1\n- Day_view_angl: Daytime View Zenith Angles (Degrees), Offset -65.0\n- LST_Night_1km: Nighttime Land Surface Temperatures (K),  Scale 0.02\n- QC_Night: Nighttime Surface Temperature quality control assessments,\n      see QC bit flags\n- Night_view_time: Nighttime LST Observation Times (Hours), Scale 0.1\n- Night_view_angl: Nighttime View Zenith Angles (Degrees), Offset -65.0\n- Emis_31: Bands 31 Emissivity, Scale 0.002, Offset 0.49\n- Emis_32: Bands 32 Emissivity, Scale 0.002, Offset 0.49\n- Clear_sky_days: Clear Sky Day Coverage, see Clear Sky Flags.\n- Clear_sky_nights: Clear Sky Nighttime Coverage, see Clear Sky Flags.\n\nQC bit flags:\n\n- Bits 0-1: Mandatory QC Flag\n   - 00: LST produced, good quality, not necessary to examine detailed QC.\n   - 01: LST produced, unreliable or unquantifiable quality, recommend examination of more detailed QC.\n   - 10: LST not produced due to cloud effects.\n   - 11: LST not produced primarily due to reasons other than clouds.\n- Bits 2-3: Data Quality Flag\n   - 00: Good quality L1B in bands 31 and 32.\n   - 01: Other quality data.\n   - 10: TBD\n   - 11: TBD\n- Bits 4-5: Emissivity Error Flag\n   - 00: Average emissivity error &le; 0.01\n   - 01: Average emissivity error &le; 0.02\n   - 10: Average emissivity error &le; 0.04\n   - 11: Average emissivity error &gt; 0.04\n- Bits 6-7: LST Error Flag\n   - 00: Average LST error &le; 1 K\n   - 01: Average LST error &le; 2 K\n   - 10: Average LST error &le; 3 K\n   - 11: Average LST error &gt; 3 K\n\nClear Sky Flags:\n\n- Clear Sky Flag for each day (bit 0 is day 1, bit 1 is day 2, etc):\n   - 0: Day/Night is not clear-sky.\n   - 1: Day/Night is clear-sky.\n\nVersion-5 MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity products\nare Validated Stage 2, meaning that accuracy has been assessed over a\nwidely distributed set of locations and time periods via several\nground-truth and validation efforts. Although there may be later\nimproved versions, these data are ready for use in scientific\npublications.\n\nPlease visit [LP DAAC 'Citing Our Data' page](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/citing_our_data) for information on citing LP DAAC datasets.\n",
