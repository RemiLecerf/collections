  "description": "The MODIS Surface Reflectance products\nprovide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be\nmeasured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or\nabsorption. Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and\naerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded\nlevel-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.\n\nMYD09A1 provides\nBands 1-7 at 500-meter resolution in an 8-day gridded level-3 product in the\nSinusoidal projection. Each MYD09A1 pixel contains the best possible L2G\nobservation during an 8-day period as selected on the basis of high observation\ncoverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol\nloading. Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance values\nfor Bands 1-7, quality assessment, and the day of the year for the pixel along\nwith solar, view, and zenith angles.\n\nPlease visit [LP DAAC 'Citing Our Data' page](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/citing_our_data) for information on citing LP DAAC datasets.\n",
