  "description": "The MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature and\nEmissivity (LST/E) product, MYD11A1, provides per-pixel temperature and\nemissivity values, which are produced daily using the generalized split-window\nLST algorithm.  This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of\natmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into\ntractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in bands 31 and 32 are estimated\nfrom land cover types.\n\nThe V5 MYD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the\nlevel-2 LST product (MYD11_L2) on 1-kilometer (precisely 0.928-km) grids. The\nMYD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for\ndaytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments,\nobservation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and bands 31 and 32\nemissivities from land cover types.\n\nThe V5 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11A1, are validated to\nStage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies.\n\nPlease visit [LP DAAC 'Citing Our Data' page](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/citing_our_data) for information on citing LP DAAC datasets.\n",
