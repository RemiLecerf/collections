  "description": "The MCD43C3 Version 6.1\nBidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Albedo\ndataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua MODIS data in a 0.05\ndegree (5,600 meters at the equator) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). Data are\ntemporally weighted to the ninth day of the retrieval period which is reflected\nin the Julian date in the file name. This CMG product covers the entire globe\nfor use in climate simulation models.\n\nMCD43C3 provides black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance)\nand white-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) at local solar noon.\nBlack-sky albedo and white-sky albedo values are available as a separate layer\nfor MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 as well as the visible, near infrared\n(NIR), and shortwave bands. Along with the 20 albedo layers are ancillary\nlayers for quality, local solar noon, percent finer resolution inputs, snow\ncover, and uncertainty.\n\nSee\n[dataset user guide](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006/mcd43c3)\nfor more information.\n",
