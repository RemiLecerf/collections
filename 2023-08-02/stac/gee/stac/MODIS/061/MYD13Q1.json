  "description": "The MYD13Q1 V6.1 product provides a Vegetation Index (VI)\nvalue at a per pixel basis. There are two primary vegetation layers.\nThe first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\nwhich is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution\nRadiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer\nis the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background\nvariations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions.\nThe EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination\ncaused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI\nand EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional\nsurface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy\naerosols, and cloud shadows.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/103/MOD13_User_Guide_V6.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/104/MOD13_ATBD.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/filespec/MODIS/61/MOD13A2)\n",
