  "description": "The MCD18C2 Version 6.1 is a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS) Terra and Aqua combined Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)\ngridded Level 3 product produced daily at 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the\nequator) resolution with estimates of PAR every 3 hours. PAR is incident\nsolar radiation in the visible spectrum (400-700 nanometers) and is an\nimportant variable in land-surface models that address a variety of\nscientific and application issues. The MCD18 products are based on a\nprototyping algorithm that uses multi-temporal signatures of MODIS data to\nderive surface reflectance and then calculate incident PAR using the look-up\ntable (LUT) approach. The LUTs consider different types of loadings of\naerosols and clouds at a variety of illumination/viewing geometry. Global\nPAR products are generated from MODIS and geostationary satellite data.\nAdditional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are\navailable in the\n[Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/106/MCD18_ATBD.pdf)\n\nProvided in the MOD18C2 product are layers for instantaneous PAR array for\neach individual MODIS overpass and 3-hour PAR array along with a View Zenith\nAngle layer.\n",
