  "description": "The MYD11A1 V6.1 product provides daily land surface temperature\n(LST) and emissivity values in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid. The\ntemperature value is derived from the MYD11_L2 swath product. Above\n30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations\nwhere the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the\npixel value is the average of all qualifying observations. Provided\nalong with both the day-time and night-time surface temperature\nbands and their quality indicator layers are MODIS bands 31 and\n32 and six observation layers.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/118/MOD11_User_Guide_V6.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/119/MOD11_ATBD.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/filespec/MODIS/61/MYD11A1)\n",
