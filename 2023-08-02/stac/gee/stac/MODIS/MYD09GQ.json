  "description": "The MODIS Surface Reflectance products\nprovide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be\nmeasured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or\nabsorption. Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and\naerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded\nlevel-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.\n\nMYD09GQ provides Bands\n1 and 2 at a 250-meter resolution in a daily gridded L2G product in\nthe Sinusoidal projection. Science Data Sets provided for this product\ninclude reflectance for Bands 1 and 2, a quality rating, observation\ncoverage, and observation number. This product is meant to be used in\nconjunction with the MOD09GA where important quality and viewing\ngeometry information is stored.\n\nPlease visit [LP DAAC 'Citing Our Data' page](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/citing_our_data) for information on citing LP DAAC datasets.\n",
