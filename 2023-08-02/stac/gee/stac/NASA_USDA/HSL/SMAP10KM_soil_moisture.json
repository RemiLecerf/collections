  "description": "This dataset is being superseded by [SPL4SMGP.007](NASA_SMAP_SPL4SMGP_007)\n\nThe NASA-USDA Enhanced SMAP Global soil moisture data provides soil moisture information across\nthe globe at 10-km spatial resolution. This dataset includes:\n[surface](https://gimms.gsfc.nasa.gov/SMOS/SMAP/Surface_Soil_Moisture_SMAP.pdf)\nand [subsurface](https://gimms.gsfc.nasa.gov/SMOS/SMAP/Sub_SurfaceSoil_Moisture_SMAP.pdf)\nsoil moisture (mm),\n[soil moisture profile](https://gimms.gsfc.nasa.gov/SMOS/SMAP/SoilMoisture_Profile_SMAP.pdf) (%),\nsurface and subsurface soil moisture anomalies (-).\n\nThe dataset is generated by integrating satellite-derived Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)\nLevel 3 soil moisture observations into the modified two-layer Palmer model using a 1-D\nEnsemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach.\nSoil moisture anomalies were computed from the climatology of the day of interest.\nThe climatology was estimated based on the full data record of the SMAP satellite observation\nand the 31-day-centered moving-window approach. The assimilation of the SMAP soil moisture\nobservations help improve the model-based soil moisture predictions particularly over poorly\ninstrumented areas of the world that lack good quality precipitation data.\n\nThis dataset was developed by the Hydrological Science Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space\nFlight Center in cooperation with USDA Foreign Agricultural Services and USDA Hydrology\nand Remote Sensing Lab.\n",
