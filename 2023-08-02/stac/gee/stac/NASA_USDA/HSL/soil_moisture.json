  "description": "The NASA-USDA Global soil moisture and the NASA-USDA SMAP Global soil\nmoisture dataset provide soil moisture information across the globe at\n0.25°x0.25° spatial resolution. These datasets include\n[surface](https://gimms.gsfc.nasa.gov/SMOS/SMAP/Surface_Soil_Moisture_SMAP.pdf)\nand [subsurface](https://gimms.gsfc.nasa.gov/SMOS/SMAP/Sub_SurfaceSoil_Moisture_SMAP.pdf)\nsoil moisture (mm),\n[soil moisture profile](https://gimms.gsfc.nasa.gov/SMOS/SMAP/SoilMoisture_Profile_SMAP.pdf) (%),\nand surface and subsurface soil moisture anomalies. Soil moisture anomalies\nare unitless and represent standardized\nanomalies computed using a 31-days moving window. Values around 0\nindicate typical moisture conditions, while very positive and very\nnegative values indicate extreme wetting (soil moisture conditions are\nabove average) and drying (soil moisture conditions are below average),\nrespectively.\n\nThis dataset is generated by integrating\nsatellite-derived Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 soil moisture\nobservations into the modified two-layer Palmer model using a 1-D Ensemble\nKalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach. The assimilation of the\nSMOS soil moisture observations helped improve the model-based soil\nmoisture predictions particularly over poorly instrumented areas\n(e.g., Southern African, Middle East) of the world that lack good quality\nprecipitation data.\n\nThis dataset was developed by the Hydrological Science Laboratory (HSL) at\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in cooperation with USDA Foreign\nAgricultural Services and USDA Hydrology and Remote Sensing Lab.\n",
