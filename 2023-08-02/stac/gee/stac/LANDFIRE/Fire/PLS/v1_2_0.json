  "description": "LANDFIRE (LF), Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a\nshared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture's Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior's\nGeological Survey, and The Nature Conservancy.\n\nLandfire (LF) Historical fire regimes, intervals, and vegetation conditions\nare mapped using the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT).\nThese data support fire and landscape management planning goals in\nthe National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, the Federal Wildland\nFire Management Policy, and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.\n\nThe Percent of Low-severity Fire (PLS) layer quantifies the amount of low-severity fires relative to mixed- and replacement-severity fires under the presumed historical fire regime.\nLow severity is defined as less than 25 percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given vegetation type.\nPLS was derived from the vegetation and disturbance dynamics model VDDT (Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool) (LF 1.0.0 CONUS only used the vegetation and disturbance dynamics model LANDSUM).\nThis layer is intended to describe one component of historical fire regime characteristics in the context of the broader historical time period represented by the LANDFIRE (LF) Biophysical Settings (BPS) layer and BPS Model documentation.\nThis layer is created by linking the BPS Group attribute in the BPS layer with the Refresh Model Tracker (RMT) data and assigning the PLS attribute.\nThis geospatial product should display a reasonable approximation of PLS, as documented in the RMT.\nPLS is used in landscape assessments.\n\nThe LANDIFRE Fire datasets include:\n\n* Fire Regime Groups (FRG) is intended to characterize presumed historical\n  fire regimes within landscapes based on interactions between vegetation\n  dynamics, fire spread, fire effects, and spatial context\n* Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI) quantifies the average period between\n  fires under the presumed historical fire regime\n* Percent of Low-severity Fire (PLS) image quantifies the amount of\n  low-severity fires relative to mixed- and replacement-severity fires\n  under the presumed historical fire regime and is defined as less than 25\n  percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given\n  vegetation type\n* Percent of Mixed-severity Fire (PMS) layer quantifies the amount of\n  mixed-severity fires relative to low- and replacement-severity fires under\n  the presumed historical fire regime, and is defined as between 25 and 75\n  percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given\n  vegetation type\n* Percent of Replacement-severity Fire (PRS) layer quantifies the amount of\n  replacement-severity fires relative to low- and mixed-severity fires under\n  the presumed historical fire regime, and is defined as greater than 75\n  percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given\n  vegetation type\n* Succession Classes (SClass) layer characterizes current vegetation conditions\n  with respect to the vegetation species composition, cover, and height ranges\n  of successional states that occur within each biophysical setting\n* Vegetation Condition Class (VCC) represents a simple categorization of the\n  associated Vegetation Departure (VDEP) layer and indicates the general level\n  to which current vegetation is different from the simulated historical\n  vegetation reference conditions\n* Vegetation Departure (VDep) indicates how different current vegetation on a\n  landscape is from estimated historical conditions. VDep is based on changes\n  to species composition, structural stage, and canopy closure.\n",
