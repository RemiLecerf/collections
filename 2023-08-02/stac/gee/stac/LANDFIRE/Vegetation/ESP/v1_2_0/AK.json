  "description": "LANDFIRE (LF), Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a\nshared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture's Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior's\nGeological Survey, and The Nature Conservancy.\n\nLANDFIRE (LF) layers are created using predictive landscape models based on\nextensive field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient\nlayers using classification and regression trees.\n\nLANDFIRE's (LF) Environmental Site Potential (ESP) represents the vegetation that could be supported at a given site based on the biophysical environment.\nMap units are based on NatureServe's Ecological Systems classification and represent the natural plant communities that may have been present during the reference period.\nESP map units represent the natural plant communities that would become established at late or climax stages of successional development in the absence of disturbance.\nThey reflect the current climate and physical environment, as well as the competitive potential of native plant species. The ESP concept is similar to that used in classifications of potential vegetation, including habitat types and plant associations.\nIn early versions of LF, ESP was used to inform the existing vegetation and fuel mapping processes.\n\nThe LANDIFRE Vegetation datasets include:\n\n* Biophysical Settings (BPS)\n* Environmental Site Potential (ESP)\n* Existing Vegetation Canopy Cover (EVC)\n* Existing Vegetation Height (EVH).\n* Existing Vegetation Type (EVT)\nThese layers are created using predictive landscape models based on extensive\nfield-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient layers using\nclassification and regression trees.\n",
