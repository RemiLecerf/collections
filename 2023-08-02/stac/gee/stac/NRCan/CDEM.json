In these data, elevations can be either\nground or reflective surface elevations.\n\nThe CDEM is comprised of multiple DEMs with varying resolutions. These\nvary according to latitude and have a base resolution of 0.75 arc-seconds.\nFor more information see the [Product Specifications](https://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/elevation/cdem_mnec/doc/CDEM_product_specs.pdf)\n\nContains information licensed under the\n[Open Government Licence - Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada).\n",
