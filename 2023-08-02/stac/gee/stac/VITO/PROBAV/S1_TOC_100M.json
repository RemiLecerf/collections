  "description": "Proba-V is a satellite mission tasked to map land cover and vegetation\ngrowth. It was designed to provide continuity for the VGT optical instrument\nfrom the SPOT-4 and SPOT-5 missions.\n\nThe sensor collects data in three VNIR (visible and near-infrared) bands\nand one SWIR (short-wave infrared) spectral band with a 2250km field of\nview. Global images are produced every 2 days at 300m resolution, and a 100m\nimage from nadir observations every 5 days. These images are later\ncomposited to produce this daily synthesis dataset. The description of\nthe compositing and atmospheric correction procedures can be found in\nthe [user manual](https://proba-v.vgt.vito.be/sites/proba-v.vgt.vito.be/files/products_user_manual.pdf).\n\nThe reflectances provided in this dataset are presented as Digital Count\nNumbers (DN) and must be converted according to the guidelines in\nSection 4.6.1 of the [user manual](https://proba-v.vgt.vito.be/sites/proba-v.vgt.vito.be/files/products_user_manual.pdf).\n",
