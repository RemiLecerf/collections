  "description": "This gap-filled Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) dataset was created by applying\nthe tasseled-cap equations defined in Lobser and Cohen (2007) to\nMODIS BRDF-corrected imagery (MCD43B4). The resulting data were\ngap-filled using the approach outlined in Weiss et al. (2014) to eliminate\nmissing data caused by factors such as cloud cover, and then the data were\naggregated temporally and spatially to produce the monthly &asymp;5km product.\n\nThis dataset was produced by Harry Gibson and Daniel Weiss of the\nMalaria Atlas Project (Big Data Institute, University of Oxford,\nUnited Kingdom, [https://malariaatlas.org/](https://malariaatlas.org/)).\n",
