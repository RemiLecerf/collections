  "description": "The underlying dataset for this daytime product is MODIS land surface\ntemperature data (MOD11A2), which was gap-filled using the approach\noutlined in Weiss et al. (2014) to eliminate missing data caused by factors\nsuch as cloud cover. Gap-free outputs were then aggregated temporally and\nspatially to produce the monthly &asymp;5km product.\n\nThis dataset was produced by Harry Gibson and Daniel Weiss of the\nMalaria Atlas Project (Big Data Institute, University of Oxford,\nUnited Kingdom, [https://malariaatlas.org/](https://malariaatlas.org/)).\n",
