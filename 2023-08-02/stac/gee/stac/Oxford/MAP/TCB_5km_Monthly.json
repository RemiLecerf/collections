  "description": "This gap-filled Tasseled Cap Brightness (TCB) dataset was created by\napplying the tasseled-cap equations defined in Lobser and Cohen (2007) to\nMODIS BRDF-corrected imagery (MCD43B4). The resulting data were gap-filled\nusing the approach outlined in Weiss et al. (2014) to eliminate missing\ndata caused by factors such as cloud cover, and then the data were\naggregated temporally and spatially to produce the monthly &asymp;5km product.\n\nThis dataset was produced by Harry Gibson and Daniel Weiss of the\n[Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org/).\n",
