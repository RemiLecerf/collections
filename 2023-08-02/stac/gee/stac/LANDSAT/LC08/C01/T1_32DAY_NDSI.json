  "description": "These Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 composites are made from Tier 1 orthorectified scenes, using the\n  computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.\n  See [Chander et al. (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\n  for details on the TOA computation.\n\nThe Normalized Difference Snow Index is used to\nidentify snow, based on its characteristically higher reflectance in\nthe visible portion of the spectrum compared to the mid-IR.  NDSI is\ncomputed using the Green and Mid-IR bands, and has a range of -1.0 to\n1.0. See\n[Riggs et al. (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399618)\nfor details.\n\nThese composites are created from\nall the scenes in\neach 32-day period beginning from the first day of the year and\ncontinuing to the 352nd day of the year.  The last composite of the\nyear, beginning on day 353, will overlap the first composite of the\nfollowing year by 20 days.  All the images from each 32-day period are\nincluded in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.\n",
