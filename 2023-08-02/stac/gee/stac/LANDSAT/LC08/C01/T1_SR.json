  "description": "This dataset is the atmospherically corrected\nsurface reflectance from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensors.\nThese images contain 5 visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands and\n2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands processed to orthorectified surface\nreflectance, and two thermal infrared (TIR) bands processed to orthorectified\nbrightness temperature\n\nThese data have been atmospherically corrected using\n[LaSRC](https://prd-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/atoms/files/LSDS-1368_L8_C1-LandSurfaceReflectanceCode-LASRC_ProductGuide-v3.pdf)\nand includes a cloud, shadow, water and snow mask produced using\n[CFMASK](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/cfmask-algorithm),\nas well as a per-pixel saturation mask.\n\nStrips of collected data are packaged into overlapping \"scenes\" covering approximately\n170km x 183km using a [standardized reference grid](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/worldwide-reference-system).\n\nSee also [the USGS page on SR QA bands](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-surface-reflectance-quality-assessment).\n\nSR can only be produced for Landsat assets processed to the\n[L1TP level](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-levels-processing)\n\nData provider notes:\n\n- Although Surface Reflectance can be processed only from the Operational\n  Land Imager (OLI) bands, SR requires combined OLI/Thermal Infrared\n  Sensor (TIRS) product (LC8) input in order to generate the accompanying\n  cloud mask. Therefore, OLI only (LO8), and TIRS only (LT8) data products\n  cannot be calculated to SR.\n- SR is not run for a scene with a solar zenith angle greater than 76&deg;.\n- Users are cautioned to avoid using SR for data acquired\n  over high latitudes (&gt; 65&deg;).\n- The panchromatic band (ETM+ Band 7, OLI Band 8) is not processed to\n  Surface Reflectance.\n- Efficacy of SR correction will be likely reduced in areas where atmospheric\n  correction is affected by adverse conditions:\n    - Hyper-arid or snow-covered regions\n    - Low sun angle conditions\n    - Coastal regions where land area is small relative to adjacent water\n    - Areas with extensive cloud contamination\n\nThis product is generated by Google using a Docker image supplied by USGS.\n",
