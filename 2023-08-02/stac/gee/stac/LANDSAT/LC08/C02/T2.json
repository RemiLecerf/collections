This includes Systematic terrain (L1GT) and\nSystematic (L1GS) processed scenes, as well as any L1TP scenes that do not meet\nthe Tier 1 specifications due to significant cloud cover, insufficient ground\ncontrol, and other factors. Users interested in Tier 2 scenes can analyze the\nRMSE and other properties to determine the suitability for use in individual\napplications and studies.
