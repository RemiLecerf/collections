(2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\n  for details on the TOA computation.\nScenes not meeting Tier 1 criteria during\nprocessing are assigned to Tier 2. This includes Systematic terrain (L1GT) and\nSystematic (L1GS) processed scenes, as well as any L1TP scenes that do not meet\nthe Tier 1 specifications due to significant cloud cover, insufficient ground\ncontrol, and other factors. Users interested in Tier 2 scenes can analyze the\nRMSE and other properties to determine the suitability for use in individual\napplications and studies.
