  "description": "The Global Land Survey (GLS) 1975 is a\nglobal collection of imagery from the Landsat Multispectral\nScanner (MSS).  Most scenes were acquired by Landsat 1-3\nin 1972-1983.  A few gaps in the Landsat 1-3 data\nhave been filled with scenes acquired by Landsat 4-5 during the\nyears 1982-1987.  These data contain 4 spectral bands:\nGreen, Red, an NIR band, and a SWIR band.  In the typical\nFalse-color presentation, the images appear red because\nthe NIR band, displayed as red, highlights vegetation.\n",
