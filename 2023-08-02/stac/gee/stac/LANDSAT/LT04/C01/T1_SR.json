  "description": "This dataset is the atmospherically\ncorrected surface reflectance from the Landsat 4 ETM sensor.\nThese images contain 4 visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands and 2 short-wave\ninfrared (SWIR) bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance,\nand one thermal infrared (TIR) band processed to orthorectified brightness\ntemperature.  The VNIR and SWIR bands have a resolution of 30m / pixel.\nThe TIR band, while originally collected with a resolution of 120m / pixel\n(60m / pixel for Landsat 7) has been resampled using cubic convolution to 30m.\n\nThese data have been atmospherically corrected using\n[LEDAPS](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-7-surface-reflectance-code-ledaps-product-guide),\nand include a cloud, shadow, water and snow mask produced using\n[CFMASK](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/cfmask-algorithm),\nas well as a per-pixel saturation mask.\n\nStrips of collected data are packaged into overlapping \\\"scenes\\\" covering approximately\n170km x 183km using a [standardized reference grid](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-worldwide-reference-system-wrs).\n\nNote that\n[Landsat 7's orbit has been drifting to an earlier acquisition time since 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017221000134?via%3Dihub).\n\nSee also [the USGS page on SR QA bands](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-surface-reflectance-quality-assessment).\n\nSR can only be produced for Landsat assets processed to the\n[L1TP level](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-levels-processing)\n\nData provider notes:\n<ul>\n  <li>SR is not run for a scene with a solar zenith angle greater than 76&deg;.</li>\n  <li>Users are cautioned to avoid using SR for data acquired\n  over high latitudes (&gt; 65&deg;).</li>\n  <li>The panchromatic band (ETM+ Band 7, OLI Band 8) is not processed to\n  Surface Reflectance.</li>\n  <li>Efficacy of SR correction will be likely reduced in areas\n  where atmospheric correction is affected by adverse conditions:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Hyper-arid or snow-covered regions</li>\n      <li>Low sun angle conditions</li>\n      <li>Coastal regions where land area is small relative to adjacent water</li>\n      <li>Areas with extensive cloud contamination</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThis product is generated by Google using a Docker image supplied by USGS.\n",
