  "description": "These Landsat 4 TM Collection 1 Tier 1 composites are made from Tier 1 orthorectified scenes, using the\n  computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.\n  See [Chander et al. (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\n  for details on the TOA computation.\n\nThe Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is sensitive\nto changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies.  It is\nderived from the Near-IR band and a second IR band, &approx;1.24&mu;m when\navailable and the nearest available IR band otherwise.  It ranges in\nvalue from -1.0 to 1.0.  See\n[Gao (1996)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425796000673)\nfor details.\n\nThese composites are created from\nall the scenes in\neach annual period beginning from the first day of the year and\ncontinuing to the last day of the year.  All the images from each year\nare included in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.\n",
