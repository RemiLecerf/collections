  "description": "These Landsat 4 TM Collection 1 Tier 1 composites are made from Tier 1 orthorectified scenes, using the\n  computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.\n  See [Chander et al. (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\n  for details on the TOA computation.\n\nThe Normalized Burn Ratio Thermal (NBRT) index is\ngenerated from the Near-IR, Mid-IR (2215 nm), and Thermal bands, and\nhas a range from -1.0 to 1.0. See\n[Holden et al. (2005)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160500239008)\nfor details.\n\nThese composites are created from\nall the scenes in\neach annual period beginning from the first day of the year and\ncontinuing to the last day of the year.  All the images from each year\nare included in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.\n",
