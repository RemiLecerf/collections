  "description": "Landsat 7 Collection 2 Tier 2 DN values, representing scaled, calibrated at-sensor radiance.\nScenes not meeting Tier 1 criteria during\nprocessing are assigned to Tier 2. This includes Systematic terrain (L1GT) and\nSystematic (L1GS) processed scenes, as well as any L1TP scenes that do not meet\nthe Tier 1 specifications due to significant cloud cover, insufficient ground\ncontrol, and other factors. Users interested in Tier 2 scenes can analyze the\nRMSE and other properties to determine the suitability for use in individual\napplications and studies. See more information [in the USGS\ndocs](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collections).\n\nNote that [Landsat 7's orbit has been drifting to an earlier acquisition time since\n2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017221000134?via%3Dihub).\n",
