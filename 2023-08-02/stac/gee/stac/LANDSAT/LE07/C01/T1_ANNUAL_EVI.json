(2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\n  for details on the TOA computation.\n\nThe Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is generated from the\nNear-IR, Red and Blue bands of each scene, and ranges in value from\n-1.0 to 1.0. See\n[Huete et al. (2002)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425702000962)\nfor details.\n\nThese composites are created from\nall the scenes in\neach annual period beginning from the first day of the year and\ncontinuing to the last day of the year.  All the images from each year\nare included in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.\n",
