  "description": "These Landsat 5 TM composites are made from Level L1T orthorectified scenes, using the\ncomputed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.  See [Chander et al.\n(2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169)\nfor details on the TOA computation.\n\nAs of May 1, 2017, the USGS is no longer producing Pre-Collection Landsat, and therefore this collection is complete. Please switch to a Collection 1-based dataset. See [this documentation page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/landsat) for more information.\n\nThese composites are created from\nall the scenes in\neach annual period beginning from the first day of the year and\ncontinuing to the last day of the year.  All the images from each year\nare included in the composite, with the greenest pixel as the composite value, where\nthe greenest pixel means the pixel with the highest value of\nthe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).\n",
