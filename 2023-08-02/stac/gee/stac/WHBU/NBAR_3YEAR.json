Data Quality flags are used to select\nthe best observations from the MODIS 8-day 500 meter Nadir\nBRDF-Adjusted Reflectance imagery product.  This specific mosaic picks\nobservations from the three highest quality categories over\na 3-year period of MODIS data.\n\nThe MODIS NBAR annual mosaics have been used by government\nagencies and NGOs in tropical countries as input to generate\naboveground biomass/carbon maps. The Woods Hole Research Center has\nbeen using the dataset for country capacity building and technical\ntraining workshops in tropical countries.\n",
