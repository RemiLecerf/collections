  "description": "Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) is a simplified process-based model\nthat couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfers, canopy photosynthesis,\ntranspiration, and energy balance. It couples an atmospheric radiative transfer\nmodel and artificial neural network with forcings from MODIS atmospheric products\nto generate 5-km daily products.\n\nPublications:\n\n* Ryu Youngryel, Chongya Jiang, Hideki Kobayashi, Matteo Detto, MODIS-derived global land products of shortwave radiation and diffuse and total photosynthetically active radiation at 5km resolution from 2000.
