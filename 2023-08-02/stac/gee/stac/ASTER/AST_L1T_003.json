  "description": "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)\nis a multispectral imager that was launched on board NASA's Terra spacecraft\nin December, 1999. ASTER can collect data in 14 spectral bands from the\nvisible to the thermal infrared. Each scene covers an area of 60 x 60 km.\nThese scenes, produced by the USGS, contain calibrated at-sensor radiance,\northo-rectified and terrain corrected.\n\nNot all 14 bands were collected in each scene. An asset property named\nORIGINAL_BANDS_PRESENT contains the list of bands that are present in each\nscene.\n\nTo convert from Digital Numbers (DN) to radiance at the sensor, the unit\nconversion coefficients are available in the metadata. See\n[ASTER L1T Product Users' Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/647/AST__L1T_User_Guide_V3.pdf)\nand [ASTER L1T Product Specification](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/300/ASTER_L1T_Product_Specification.pdf)\nfor more information.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/72/AST_L1T_ATBD.pdf)\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/647/AST__L1T_User_Guide_V3.pdf)\n\n* [ASTER Level-1T Product Specification](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/300/ASTER_L1T_Product_Specification.pdf)\n\n* [ASTER L1T Quick Reference Guide(ASTER L1T Quick Reference Guide)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/174/AST_L1T_Quick_Reference_Guide.pdf)\n",
