  "description": "This dataset provides accurate actual evapotranspiration (AET or ETa) for\nAustralia using the CMRSET algorithm. The AET band (named 'ETa') contains\nthe average daily value from the CMRSET model for all cloud-free Landsat\nobservations in that month (indicated with value 3 in the AET Data Source QA\nbits). After the Landsat 7 ETM+ Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failed on 31 May\n2003, Landsat 7 ETM+ data are only used if there are no cloud-free Landsat 5\nTM or Landsat 8 OLI data for that month. If there is no cloud-free Landsat\navailable, then pixels are infilled with Landsat-VIIRS blended output\n(indicated with value 2 in the AET Data Source QA bits). If there is no\nVIIRS available in a month, then missing monthly AET values are linearly\ninterpolated (indicated with value 1 in the AET Data Source QA bits). This\nmeans monthly 30 m AET data covering all Australia, with no gaps due to\ncloud, are available and ready to use.\n\nAccurate AET information is important for irrigation, food security, and\nenvironmental management. Like many other parts of the world, water\navailability in Australia is limited and AET is the largest consumptive\ncomponent of the water balance. In Australia 70% of available water is used\nfor crop and pasture irrigation. Better monitoring will support improved\nwater use efficiency in this sector, with any water savings available as\nenvironmental flows. Additionally, ground-water dependent ecosystems (GDE)\noccupy a small area yet are \"biodiversity hotspots\". Knowing their water\nneeds enables enhanced management of these critical areas. AET can also be\nused to model the catchment water balance. If used in water balance (mass\nbalance) calculations, then this AET value needs to be multiplied by the\nnumber of days in the month.\n\nTo let the developers know you are using this dataset, to get information\non updates, or if you have any questions please contact:\ntim.mcvicar@csiro.au, tom.vanniel@csiro.au, jamie.vleeshouwer@csiro.au .\n",
