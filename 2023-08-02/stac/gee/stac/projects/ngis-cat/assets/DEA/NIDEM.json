  "description": "The National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model (NIDEM; Bishop-Taylor et\nal. 2018, 2019) is a continental-scale elevation dataset for Australia's\nexposed intertidal zone. NIDEM provides the first three-dimensional\nrepresentation of Australia's intertidal sandy beaches and shores, tidal\nflats and rocky shores and reefs at 25 m spatial resolution, addressing a\nkey gap between the availability of sub-tidal bathymetry and terrestrial\nelevation data. NIDEM was generated by combining global tidal modelling with\na 30-year time series archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat\nsatellite data managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform.\nNIDEM complements existing intertidal extent products, and provides data to\nsupport a new suite of use cases that require a more detailed understanding\nof the three-dimensional topography of the intertidal zone, such as\nhydrodynamic modelling, coastal risk management and ecological habitat\nmapping.\n\nFor more information, please see the\n[DEA Intertidal Elevation](https://cmi.ga.gov.au/data-products/dea/325/dea-intertidal-elevation-landsat#basics)\n",
