  "description": "HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic\ninformation for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent\nformat. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and\nraster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed\nboundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS\nis based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar\nTopography Mission (SRTM).\n\nThis hydrologically conditioned elevation dataset is\nthe result of an iterative conditioning and correction process.\nNote that the conditioning process alters the original DEM and\nmay render it incorrect for applications other than deriving drainage\ndirections. Endorheic basins (inland sinks) are ''seeded'' with\na no-data cell at their lowest point in order to terminate the\nflow. Full details of the underlying digital elevation model are\navailable in the HydroSHEDS website and documentation.\n\nThis dataset is at 30 arc-second resolution. The datasets available\nat 30 arc-seconds are the Hydrologically Conditioned DEM, Drainage\n(Flow) Direction, and Flow Accumulation.\n\nNote that the quality of the HydroSHEDS data is significantly lower for regions above\n60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available\nand thus a coarser-resolution DEM was (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).\n\nHydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\nConservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological\nSurvey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The\nNature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research\nof the University of Kassel, Germany.\n",
