  "description": "The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data represent the primary\nlong-term, continuous record of satellite-based observations available for\nuse in monitoring global and regional trends in total ozone over the past\n25 years. The data are produced by the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA's\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Version 8 TOMS data products include level 3\ngridded data (1.0 x 1.25 deg). The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), aboard\nthe Aura satellite (July 2004 - current), has a higher resolution\n(1.0 x 1.0 deg).\n\nThese data represent a merged ozone product from TOMS/EarthProbe,\nTOMS/Nimbus-7, TOMS/Meteor-3, OMI/Aura and USGS-interpolated data for dates\nwith no data.\n\n[Additional TOMS and OMI information](https://ozoneaq.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/)\n",
