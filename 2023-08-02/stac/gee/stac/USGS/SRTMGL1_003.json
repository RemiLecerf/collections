This\nSRTM V3 product (SRTM Plus) is provided by NASA JPL\nat a resolution of 1 arc-second (approximately 30m).\n\nThis dataset has undergone a void-filling process using open-source data\n(ASTER GDEM2, GMTED2010, and NED), as opposed to other versions that\ncontain voids or have been void-filled with commercial sources.\nFor more information on the different versions see the\n[SRTM Quick Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/13/SRTM_Quick_Guide.pdf).\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/13/SRTM_Quick_Guide.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2005RG000183)\n",
