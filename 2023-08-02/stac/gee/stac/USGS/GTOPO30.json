  "description": "GTOPO30 is a global digital elevation model (DEM) with\na horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 kilometer).\nThe DEM was derived from several raster and vector sources of topographic\ninformation.  Completed in late 1996, GTOPO30 was developed over\na three-year period through a collaborative effort led by the U.S.\nGeological Survey''s Center for Earth Resources Observation and\nScience (EROS). The following organizations  participated by contributing\nfunding or source data:  the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration\n(NASA), the United Nations Environment Programme/Global Resource\nInformation Database (UNEP/GRID), the U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografica\ne Informatica (INEGI) of Mexico, the Geographical Survey Institute  (GSI)\nof Japan, Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research of New Zealand, and\nthe  Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).\n",
