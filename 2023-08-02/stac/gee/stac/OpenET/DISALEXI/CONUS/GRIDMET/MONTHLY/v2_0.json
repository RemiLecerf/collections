  "description": "Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse / Disaggregation of the Atmosphere-Land\nExchange Inverse (ALEXI/DisALEXI)\n\nDisALEXI was recently ported to Google Earth Engine as part of the OpenET\nframework and the baseline ALEXI/DisALEXI model structure is described by\nAnderson et al. (2012, 2018). The ALEXI evapotranspiration (ET) model\nspecifically uses time differential land surface temperature (LST)\nmeasurements from geostationary or moderate resolution polar orbiting\nplatforms to generate regional ET maps. DisALEXI then disaggregates the\nregional ALEXI ET to finer scales using Landsat data (30 m; biweekly) to\nresolve individual farm fields and other landscape features.\n[Additional information](https://openetdata.org/methodologies/)\n",
