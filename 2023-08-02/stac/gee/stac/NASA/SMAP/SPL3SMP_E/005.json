  "description": "This Level-3 (L3) soil moisture product provides a daily composite of global\nland surface conditions retrieved by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)\nL-Band radiometer. The daily data here were collected from the descending\n(local solar time of 6 am) and ascending (local solar time of 6 pm) passes.\n\nThe SMAP mission is an orbiting observatory that measures the amount of\nwater in the surface soil everywhere on Earth. A detailed description can be\nfound in the [SMAP Handbook]\n(https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/178_SMAP_Handbook_FINAL_1_JULY_2014_Web.pdf).\nIt was launched in January 2015 and started operation in April 2015. The\nradar instrument, ceasing operation in early 2015 due to failure of radar\npower supply, collected close to 3 months of science data. The prime mission\nphase of three years was completed in 2018, and since then SMAP has been in\nextended operation phase.\n\nSMAP measures soil moisture every 2-3 days. This permits changes around\nthe world to be observed over time scales ranging from major storms to\nrepeated measurements of changes over the seasons.\n\nEverywhere on Earth not covered with water or not frozen, SMAP measures how\nmuch water is in the top layer of soil. It also distinguishes between ground\nthat is frozen or thawed. Where the ground is not frozen, SMAP measures the\namount of water found between the minerals, rocky material, and organic\nparticles found in soil everywhere in the world (SMAP measures liquid water\nin the top layer of ground but is not able to measure the ice.)\n\nSee the\n[SMAP L3 Soil Moisture User Guide](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/spl3smp_e-v005-userguide.pdf)\nand references therein for additional documentation and algorithm details.\n",
