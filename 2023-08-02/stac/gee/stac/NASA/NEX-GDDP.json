  "description": "The NASA NEX-GDDP dataset is comprised of downscaled climate scenarios\nfor the globe that are derived from the General Circulation Model (GCM)\nruns conducted under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5\n(CMIP5, see [Taylor et al. 2012](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00094.1))\nand across two of the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see [Meinshausen et\nal. 2011](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0156-z#page-1)).\nThe CMIP5 GCM runs were developed in support of the Fifth Assessment\nReport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5).\n\nThis dataset was prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames\nResearch Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA\nCenter for Climate Simulation (NCCS).\n",
