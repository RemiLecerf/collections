  "description": "The Global Flood Database contains maps of the extent and\ntemporal distribution of 913 flood events occurring between 2000-2018. For more\ninformation, see\n[the associated journal article](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-65906/v1).\n\nFlood events were collected from\nthe [Dartmouth Flood Observatory](https://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/)\nand used to collect MODIS imagery. The selected\n913 events are those that were successfully mapped (passed quality control as\nhaving significant inundation beyond permanent water) using 12,719 scenes from\nTerra and Aqua MODIS sensors. Each pixel was classified as water or non-water\nat 250-meter resolution during the full date range of each flood event and\nsubsequent data products were generated including maximum flood extent\n(\"flooded\" band) and the duration of inundation in days (\"duration\" band).\nWater and non-water classifications during a flood event include permanent\nwater (here resampling the 30-meter\n[JRC Global Surface Water dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/)\nrepresenting permanent water to 250-meter resolution), which can be\nmasked out to isolate flood water using the \"jrc_perm_water\" band.\nExtra data quality\nbands were added representing cloud conditions during the flood event (e.g.,\n\"clear_views\" representing the number of clear days the flood was observed\nbetween its start and end dates and \"clear_perc\" representing the percentage of\nclear day observation of the total event duration in days).\n\nEach image in the ImageCollection represents the map of an individual flood.\nThe collection can be filtered\nby date, country, or Dartmouth Flood Observatory original ID.\n\nThe dataset website is currently in development, so the provider link\npoints at the current page.",
