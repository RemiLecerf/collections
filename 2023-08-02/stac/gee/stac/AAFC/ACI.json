  "description": "Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology\nBranch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process\nof generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie\nProvinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was\napplied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based\nsatellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has\nbeen extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory.\nTo date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets\nthe overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of\n30m (56m in 2009 and 2010).\n",
