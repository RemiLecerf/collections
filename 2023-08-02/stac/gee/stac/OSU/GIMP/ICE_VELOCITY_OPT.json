  "description": "This dataset, part of the NASA Making Earth System Data\nRecords for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program,\nconsists of mean monthly velocity maps for selected glacier outlet areas.\nThe maps are generated by tracking visible features between optical\nimage pairs acquired by the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM),\nthe Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), the Landsat 8\nOperational Land Imager (OLI), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal\nEmission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER).\n\n**Note**\n\nMonthly means are calculated from images, which may have acquisition\ndates from the preceding or succeeding month. For the naming convention,\nthe month is determined from where the midpoint Julian dates fall.\nFor example, September monthly means may have been generated from\nimages that were acquired in August or in October but the midpoint\nJulian date between the images falls within September. The exact\ndates used are included as per-image metadata fields.\n\n[General documentation](https://doi.org/10.5067/VM5DZ20MYF5C)\n",
