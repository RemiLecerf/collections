  "description": "The Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4) models the distribution\nof global human population for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020\non 30 arc-second (approximately 1km) grid cells. Population is distributed\nto cells using proportional allocation of population from census and\nadministrative units. Population input data are collected at the most\ndetailed spatial resolution available from the results of the 2010 round of\ncensuses, which occurred between 2005 and 2014. The input data are\nextrapolated to produce population estimates for each modeled year.\n\nThese ancillary data grids contain additional per-pixel data that can be\nused to assess the quality of the population estimates and how they were\nproduced.\n\n[General Documentation](https://beta.sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-land-water-area/docs)\n",
