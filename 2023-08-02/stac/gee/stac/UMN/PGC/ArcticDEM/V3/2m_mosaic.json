  "description": "ArcticDEM is a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and National\nScience Foundation (NSF) public-private initiative to automatically produce\na high-resolution, high-quality digital surface model (DSM) of the Arctic\nusing optical stereo imagery, high-performance computing, and open source\nphotogrammetry software. It includes vegetation, tree canopy, buildings, and\nother man-made surface features. The 2m asset is a collection of strips rather\nthan a single mosaic due to projection differences between strips.\n\nMosaicked DEM files are compiled from the best quality strip DEM files\nwhich have been blended and feathered to reduce void areas and edge-matching\nartifacts. Filtered IceSAT altimetry data has been applied to the raster\nfiles to improve absolute accuracy.\n",
