  "description": "The Copernicus DEM is a digital surface model (DSM), which represents the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure, and vegetation. This DSM is based on radar satellite data acquired during the TanDEM-X Mission, which was funded by a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and Airbus Defence and Space.\n\nCopernicus DEM is available at both 30-meter and 90-meter resolution; this dataset has a horizontal resolution of approximately 30 meters.\n\nSee the [Product Handbook](https://object.cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/Copernicus_metadata.pdf) for more information.\n\nSee the dataset page on OpenTopography: <https://doi.org/10.5069/G9028PQB>\n\n",
