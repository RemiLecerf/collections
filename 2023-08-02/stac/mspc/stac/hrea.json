  "description": "The [HREA](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~brianmin/HREA/index.html) project aims to provide open access to new indicators of electricity access and reliability across the world. Leveraging satellite imagery with computational methods, these high-resolution data provide new tools to track progress toward reliable and sustainable energy access across the world.\n\nThis dataset includes settlement-level measures of electricity access, reliability, and usage for 89 nations, derived from nightly VIIRS satellite imagery. Specifically, this dataset provides the following annual values at country-level granularity:\n\n1. **Access**: Predicted likelihood that a settlement is electrified, based on night-by-night comparisons of each settlement against matched uninhabited areas over a calendar year.\n\n2. **Reliability**: Proportion of nights a settlement is statistically brighter than matched uninhabited areas. Areas with more frequent power outages or service interruptions have lower rates.\n\n3. **Usage**: Higher levels of brightness indicate more robust usage of outdoor lighting, which is highly correlated with overall energy consumption.\n\n4. **Nighttime Lights**: Annual composites of VIIRS nighttime light output.\n\nFor more information and methodology, please visit the [HREA website](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~brianmin/HREA/index.html).\n",
