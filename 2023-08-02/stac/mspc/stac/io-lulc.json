This item will be retired in December 2024. There is 2020 data available in the newer [9-class dataset](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-lulc-9-class)._\n\nGlobal estimates of 10-class land use/land cover (LULC) for 2020, derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution.  This dataset was generated by [Impact Observatory](http://impactobservatory.com/), who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification.  The global map was produced by applying this model to the relevant yearly Sentinel-2 scenes on the Planetary Computer.\n\nThis dataset is also available on the [ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/).\n",
