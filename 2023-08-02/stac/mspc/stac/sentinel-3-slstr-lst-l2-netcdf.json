  "description": "This Collection provides Sentinel-3 [SLSTR Level-2 Land Surface Temperature](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/product-types/level-2-lst) products containing data on land surface temperature measurements on a 1km grid. Radiance is measured in two channels to determine the temperature of the Earth's surface skin in the instrument field of view, where the term \"skin\" refers to the top surface of bare soil or the effective emitting temperature of vegetation canopies as viewed from above.\n\n## Data files\n\nThe dataset includes data on the primary measurement variable, land surface temperature, in a single NetCDF file, `LST_in.nc`. A second file, `LST_ancillary.nc`, contains several ancillary variables:\n\n- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index\n- Surface biome classification\n- Fractional vegetation cover\n- Total water vapor column\n\nIn addition to the primary and ancillary data files, a standard set of annotation data files provide meteorological information, geolocation and time coordinates, geometry information, and quality flags. More information about the product and data processing can be found in the [User Guide](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/product-types/level-2-lst) and [Technical Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/level-2/lst-processing).\n\nThis Collection contains Level-2 data in NetCDF files from April 2016 to present.\n\n## STAC Item geometries\n\nThe Collection contains small \"chips\" and long \"stripes\" of data collected along the satellite direction of travel. Approximately five percent of the STAC Items describing long stripes of data contain geometries that encompass a larger area than an exact concave hull of the data extents. This may require additional filtering when searching the Collection for Items that spatially intersect an area of interest.\n",
