  "description": "The Ocean Heat Content Climate Data Record (CDR) is a set of ocean heat content anomaly (OHCA) time-series for 1955-present on 3-monthly, yearly, and pentadal (five-yearly) scales. This CDR quantifies ocean heat content change over time, which is an essential metric for understanding climate change and the Earth's energy budget. It provides time-series for multiple depth ranges in the global ocean and each of the major basins (Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian) divided by hemisphere (Northern, Southern).\n\nThis is a NetCDF-only collection, for Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs use collection `noaa-cdr-ocean-heat-content`.\nThe NetCDF files are delivered to Azure as part of the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination).\n",
