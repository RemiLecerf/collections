  "description": "The [Project Eclipse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-eclipse/) Network is a low-cost air quality sensing network for cities and a research project led by the [Urban Innovation Group]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/urban-innovation-research/) at Microsoft Research.\n\nProject Eclipse currently includes over 100 locations in Chicago, Illinois, USA.\n\nThis network was deployed starting in July, 2021, through a collaboration with the City of Chicago, the Array of Things Project, JCDecaux Chicago, and the Environmental Law and Policy Center as well as local environmental justice organizations in the city. [This talk]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/technology-demo-project-eclipse-hyperlocal-air-quality-monitoring-for-cities/) documents the network design and data calibration strategy.\n\n## Storage resources\n\nData are stored in [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files in Azure Blob Storage in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:\n\n`https://ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/eclipse`\n\nWithin that container, the periodic occurrence snapshots are stored in `Chicago/YYYY-MM-DD`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` corresponds to the date of the snapshot.\nEach snapshot contains a sensor readings from the next 7-days in Parquet format starting with date on the folder name YYYY-MM-DD.\nTherefore, the data files for the first snapshot are at\n\n`https://ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/eclipse/chicago/2022-01-01/data_*.parquet\n\nThe Parquet file schema is as described below. \n\n## Additional Documentation\n\nFor details on Calibration of Pm2.5, O3 and NO2, please see [this PDF](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/Calibration_Doc_v1.1.pdf).\n\n## License and attribution\nPlease cite: Daepp, Cabral, Ranganathan et al.
