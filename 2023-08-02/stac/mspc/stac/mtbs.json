  "description": "[Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity](https://www.mtbs.gov/) (MTBS) is an inter-agency program whose goal is to consistently map the burn severity and extent of large fires across the United States from 1984 to the present. This includes all fires 1000 acres or greater in the Western United States and 500 acres or greater in the Eastern United States.  The burn severity mosaics in this dataset consist of thematic raster images of MTBS burn severity classes for all currently completed MTBS fires for the continental United States and Alaska.\n",
