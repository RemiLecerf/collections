  "description": "ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate\ncovering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a\nglobally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This\nprinciple, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical\nweather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a\nprevious forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal\nway to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called\nanalysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works\nin the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a\ndataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint\nof issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and\nwhen going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions\nof the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis\nproduct.\n\nThis dataset was converted to Zarr by [Planet OS](https://planetos.com/).\nSee [their documentation](https://github.com/planet-os/notebooks/blob/master/aws/era5-pds.md)\nfor more.\n\n## STAC Metadata\n\nTwo types of data variables are provided: \"forecast\" (`fc`) and \"analysis\" (`an`).\n\n* An **analysis**, of the atmospheric conditions, is a blend of observations\n  with a previous forecast. An analysis can only provide\n  [instantaneous](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Model+grid+box+and+time+step)\n  parameters (parameters valid at a specific time, e.g temperature at 12:00),\n  but not accumulated parameters, mean rates or min/max parameters.\n* A **forecast** starts with an analysis at a specific time (the 'initialization\n  time'), and a model computes the atmospheric conditions for a number of\n  'forecast steps', at increasing 'validity times', into the future. A forecast\n  can provide\n  [instantaneous](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Model+grid+box+and+time+step)\n  parameters, accumulated parameters, mean rates, and min/max parameters.\n\nEach [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) item in this collection covers a single month\nand the entire globe. There are two STAC items per month, one for each type of data\nvariable (`fc` and `an`). The STAC items include an `ecmwf:kind` properties to\nindicate which kind of variables that STAC item catalogs.\n\n## How to acknowledge, cite and refer to ERA5\n\nAll users of data on the Climate Data Store (CDS) disks (using either the web interface or the CDS API) must provide clear and visible attribution to the Copernicus programme and are asked to cite and reference the dataset provider:\n\nAcknowledge according to the [licence to use Copernicus Products](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf).\n\nCite each dataset used as indicated on the relevant CDS entries (see link to \"Citation\" under References on the Overview page of the dataset entry).\n\nThroughout the content of your publication, the dataset used is referred to as Author (YYYY).\n\nThe 3-steps procedure above is illustrated with this example: [Use Case 2: ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1979 to present](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Use+Case+2%3A+ERA5+hourly+data+on+single+levels+from+1979+to+present).\n\nFor complete details, please refer to [How to acknowledge and cite a Climate Data Store (CDS) catalogue entry and the data published as part of it](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+acknowledge+and+cite+a+Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+catalogue+entry+and+the+data+published+as+part+of+it).",
