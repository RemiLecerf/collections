  "description": "The Ocean Heat Content Climate Data Record (CDR) is a set of ocean heat content anomaly (OHCA) time-series for 1955-present on 3-monthly, yearly, and pentadal (five-yearly) scales. This CDR quantifies ocean heat content change over time, which is an essential metric for understanding climate change and the Earth's energy budget. It provides time-series for multiple depth ranges in the global ocean and each of the major basins (Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian) divided by hemisphere (Northern, Southern).\n\nThese Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) were created from NetCDF files which are delivered to Azure as part of the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination).\nFor the NetCDF files, see collection `noaa-cdr-ocean-heat-content-netcdf`.\n",
