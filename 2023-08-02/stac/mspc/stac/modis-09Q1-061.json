  "description": "The 09Q1 Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bands 1 and 2, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with the 250 meter (m) surface reflectance bands are two quality layers. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used.",
