  "description": "This entry is a preliminary version of the ERA5 reanalysis back extension from 1950 to 1978. It has now been superseded by the ERA5 Climate Data Store entries from\n1940 onwards and will be deprecated in due course. Therefore, users are advised to use the latter, final release, instead\nAlthough in many other respects the quality of this dataset is quite satisfactory (Bell et al., 2021), this preliminary data does suffer from tropical cyclones that are sometimes unrealistically intense. This is in contrast with the ERA5 product from 1959 onwards. For more details see the articles, ERA5 back extension 1950-1978 (Preliminary version): tropical cyclones are too intense and Changes in the ERA5 back extension compared to its preliminary version.\nERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades. Currently, data is available from 1940, with superseded\nClimate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension, this page) and from 1940 onwards (final release plus timely updates). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.\nIt should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article.\nInformation on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for\nthe uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).\nThere are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels from 1950 to 1978 (preliminary version)\".\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nDivergence, Fraction of cloud cover, Geopotential, Ozone mass mixing ratio, Potential vorticity, Relative humidity, Specific cloud ice water content, Specific cloud liquid water content, Specific humidity, Specific rain water content, Specific snow water content, Temperature, U-component of wind, V-component of wind, Vertical velocity, Vorticity (relative)",
