  "description": "The Natural Colour Enhanced product is an RGB which utilises three SEVIRI solar channels: NIR1.6, VIS0.8 and VIS0.6. It is similar to a Natural Colour RGB product, with the difference that the ice-clouds and snow covered surfaces and clouds are not shown in typical cyan colour but in desaturated tones, i.e. in white shades, making it more natural for human perception. \n\nFrom 1 June 2022, Meteosat-9 at 45.5° E is the prime satellite for the IODC service, replacing Meteosat-8 (located at 41.5° E while in operation).",
