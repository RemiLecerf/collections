  "description": "Rapidly Developing Thunderstorms - Convection Warning product is a geostationary meteorological product for nowcasting applications. Using mainly MSG satellite data, it provides information on clouds related to significant convective systems, from mesoscale (200 to 2000 km) down to smaller scales (tenths of km).\n\nThe objectives of RDT are:\n•\tThe identification, monitoring and tracking of intense convective system clouds\n•\tThe detection of rapidly developing convective cells\n\nThe object-oriented approach underlying the RDT product allows for adding value to the satellite image by characterizing convective, spatially consistent, entities through various parameters of interest to the users such as motion vector, cooling rate, cloud top height, etc.\n\nIt is produced with the NWC-SAF Geo 2018.1 software package.",
