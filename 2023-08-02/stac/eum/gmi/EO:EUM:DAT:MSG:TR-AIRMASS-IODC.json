  "description": "The “Tropical Airmass” product is an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) composite derivate of the existing “Airmass RGB” visualisation. It is based upon data from infra-red channels (namely WV6.2, WV7.3, IR9.7 and IR10.8) of the SEVIRI instrument. The target of this product is an improved detection of over-shooting tops and cold, high-reaching clouds in general (typically found in the tropical regions). \n\nWith the standard Airmass RGB these clouds are in a strong white colour with no gradients on their tops.\n\nThe recipe is similar to the one of Airmass RGB with slight difference in colour range selection - in particular, for the green beam (IR9.7-IR10.8) it uses a range from -30 to +25 K (instead of -40 to +5 K).\n\nFrom 1 June 2022, Meteosat-9 at 45.5° E is the prime satellite for the IODC service, replacing Meteosat-8 (located at 41.5° E while in operation).",
