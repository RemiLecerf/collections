  "description": "The GII product consists of a set of indices which describe the stability of the atmosphere. These indices are highly empirical in nature and might even be only relevant in certain geographic regions or under certain circumstances.\nK-Index is one of the four common instability indices included in GII.\nK-index is defined as follows\nK-Index = [ T(850hPa) – T(500hPa) ] + TD(850hPa) – [ T(700hPa) – TD(700hPa) ]\nWhere: \n\t- T is the air temperature at the indicated levels,\n\t- TD the observed dew point temperature at the indicated levels",
