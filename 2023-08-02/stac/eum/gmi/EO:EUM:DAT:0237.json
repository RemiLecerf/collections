  "description": "This is a reprocessed dataset at baseline F06, which is continued by the NRT/NTC data stream from 29/April/2022 onwards.\n\nThe Level-1B LR product is output of the LR processor. It includes geo-located, and fully calibrated pulse-limited low-resolution Ku-band and C-band waveforms.\n\nThis product is most relevant to geophysical retrieval algorithm developers (over ocean, land and ice surfaces), surface characterisations studies (e.g. impact of sea state bias, wave directional effects etc) and Quality Control systems.\n\nSentinel-6 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme. It is a collaborative Copernicus mission, implemented and co-funded by the European Commission, ESA, EUMETSAT and the USA, through NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
