  "description": "The Natural Colour RGB (Red, Green, Blue) makes use of three solar\n          channels: NIR1.6, VIS0.8 and VIS0.6. In this colour scheme vegetation appears greenish\n          because of its large reflectance in the VIS0.8 channel (the green beam) compared to the\n          NIR1.6 (red beam) and VIS0.6 (blue beam) channels. Water clouds with small droplets have\n          large reflectance at all three channels and hence appear whitish, while snow and ice\n          clouds appears cyan because ice strongly absorbs in NIR1.6 (no red). Bare ground appears\n          brown because of the larger reflectance in the NIR1.6 than at VIS0.6, and the ocean\n          appears black because of the low reflectance in all three channels.",
