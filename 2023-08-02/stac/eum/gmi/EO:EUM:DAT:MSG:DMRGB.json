  "description": "The Day Microphysics RGB (Red, Green, Blue) was inherited from\n          Rosenfeld and Lensky (1998): the VIS0.8 reflectance in red approximates the cloud optical\n          depth and amount of cloud water and ice; the IR3.9 solar reflectance in green is a\n          qualitative measure for cloud particle size and phase, and the IR10.8 brightness\n          temperature modulates the blue. This color scheme is useful for cloud analysis,\n          convection, fog, snow, and fires. In this colour scheme water clouds that do not\n          precipitate appear white because cloud drops are small, whereas large drops that are\n          typical to precipitating clouds appear pink, because of the low reflectance at IR3.9\n          manifested as low green. Supercooled water clouds appear more yellow, because the lower\n          temperature that modulate the blue component. Cold and thick clouds with tops composed of\n          large ice particles, e.g., Cb tops, appear red. Optically thick clouds with small ice\n          particles near their tops appear orange.",
