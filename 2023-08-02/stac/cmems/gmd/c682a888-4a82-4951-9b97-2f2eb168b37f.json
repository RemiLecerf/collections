  "description": "\"''DEFINITION'''\n\nNINO34 sub surface temperature anomaly (°C) is defined as the difference between the subsurface temperature  averaged over the 170°W-120°W 5°S,-5°N area  and the climatological reference value over same area. Spatial averaging was weighted by surface area. Monthly mean values are given here. The reference period is 1993-2014.  \n\n'''CONTEXT'''\n\nEl Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important sources of climatic variability resulting from a strong coupling between ocean and atmosphere in the central tropical Pacific and affecting surrounding populations. Globally, it impacts ecosystems, precipitation, and freshwater resources (Glantz, 2001). ENSO is mainly characterized by two anomalous states that last from several months to more than a year and recur irregularly on a typical time scale of 2-7 years. The warm phase El Niño is broadly characterized by a weakening of the easterly trade winds at interannual timescales associated with surface and subsurface processes leading to a surface warming in the eastern Pacific. Opposite changes are observed during the cold phase La Niña (review in Wang et al., 2017). Nino 3.4 sub-surface Temperature Anomaly is a good indicator of the state of the Central tropical Pacific el Nino conditions and enable to monitor the evolution the ENSO phase.\n\n'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS '''\n\nOver the 1993-2017 period, there were several episodes of strong positive ENSO (el nino) phases in particular during the 1997/1998 winter and the 2015/2016 winter, where NINO3.4 indicator reached positive values larger than 2°C (and remained above 0.5°C during more than 6 months). Several La Nina events were also observed like during the 1998/1999 winter and during the 2010/2011 winter. \nThe NINO34 subsurface indicator is a good index to monitor the state of ENSO phase and a useful tool to help seasonal forecasting of atmospheric conditions.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n'\"\"REFERENCES'''\n\n\n\n'''DOI (product):''' \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00220",
