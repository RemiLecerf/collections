  "description": "Turbidity in inland, coastal and transitional waters, generated using a switching version of the semi-empirical single-band Nechad et al. (2009) approach. The algorithm switches between bands in function of the derived turbidity values. Lower wavelengths are more sensitive to small changes in the low turbidity range, but rapidly saturates with high turbidity. Longer wavelengths saturate less at high turbidity values, but are less sensitive for the low turbidity. B04 (665 nm) is used for turbidity levels up till 50 FNU and B08 (865 nm) for concentrations > 150 FNU. In between a weighted average of both bands is calculated. Land and clouds are masked.",
