  "description": "The WorldCereal active irrigation products provide binary maps for all growing seasons as defined by the WorldCereal global crop calendars, showing where active irrigation has been detected. Seasonally actively irrigated cropland is defined by the WorldCereal system as a piece of land that is extensively irrigated during a specific growing season where, without irrigation applied at regular intervals, crop growth would be significantly reduced or impossible. Incidental irrigation, such as irrigation that has been applied only during the sowing period of a crop, is not translated to actively irrigated cropland. The WorldCereal active irrigation products were generated within the respective annual temporary crops mask.",
