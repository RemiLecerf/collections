  "description": "Optical data collected with airborne drone platform, and processed with MapEO Water software v1 at VITO into turbidity. Turbidity indicates the relative opacity of the water column. It is an optical water property and a measure for the amount of light scattered by constituents in the water column. The higher the scattered light intensity, the higher the turbidity. Constituents that causes water to be turbid include clay, silt, very tiny inorganic and organic matter, algae, dissolved coloured organic compounds, plankton, and other microscopic organisms. Turbidity is expressed in Formazin Nephelometric Units (FNU, according to the ISO 7027 standard).",
