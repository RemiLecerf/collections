  "description": "The WorldCereal annual temporary crops products identify land used for crops with a less-than-one-year growing cycle which must be newly sown or planted for further production after the harvest. Sugar cane, asparagus and cassava are also considered as temporary crops, despite the fact that they remain in the field for more than one year. The WorldCereal temporary crops products exclude perennial crops as well as (temporary) pastures. These products are generated once a year, the period being defined in a region by the end of the last growing season that is considered by the WorldCereal system.",
