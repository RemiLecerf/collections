  "description": "The Copernicus [Sentinel-5 Precursor mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p) dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere,\nconsists of one satellite carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument. Sentinel-5 Precursor mission aims to fill in\nglobal atmospheric data gap between the retired ENVISAT and AURA missions and the future Sentinel -5 mission.The main objective of TROPOMI is \nprovide daily global observations of key atmospheric constituents related to air quality, ozone layer and climate change monitoring and forecasting. \nLevel 2 data provide total columns of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, tropospheric columns of ozone, \nvertical profiles of ozone and cloud & aerosol information. Level 2 data are available since April 2018.\nThese measurements are used for improving air quality forecasts as well as for monitoring the concentrations of atmospheric constituents.\n",
