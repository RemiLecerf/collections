These two sensors provide seasonal coverage of the global landmass.\n[Landsat 8-9 Level 2 data](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-2-level-2-science-products)\nfrom the most recently released [collection 2](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-updates-are-being-made-landsat-collection-2?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products), \nprovides atmospherically corrected Surface Reflectance and Surface Brightness Temperature products generated from Collection 2 Level-1 scenes that have been processed to Tier 1 or Tier 2.\nCollection 2 level 2 data are available since February 2013 for Landsat 8 and since January 2022 for Landsat 9 and new data are continously added usually within 24 hours after Level 1 scenes are available.\n",
