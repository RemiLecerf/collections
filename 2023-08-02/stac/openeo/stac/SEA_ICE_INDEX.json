  "description": "[Sea Ice Index](https://nsidc.org/data/G02135/versions/3) products offer information about ice cover and its trends in the Arctic and Antarctica.\n In this collection, sea ice extent and concentration maps are provided at a resolution of 25 km on a daily basis.\n The products are computed using images from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and \n Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) instruments on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)\n satellites. Sea ice concentrations are generated from \n [brightness temperature data](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051). Sea ice extent is computed as areas covered by ice\n  with a concentration greater than 15 percent. This dataset is for demonstration purposes only and is not maintained.\n",
