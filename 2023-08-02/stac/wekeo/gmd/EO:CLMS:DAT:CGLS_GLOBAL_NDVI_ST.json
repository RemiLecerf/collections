  "description": "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used, dimensionless index that is indicative for vegetation density and is defined as NDVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red) where NIR corresponds to the reflectance in the near infrared bands, and Red to the reflectance in the red bands. The time series of 10-daily NDVI 1km version 3 observations is used to calculate Long Term Statistics (LTS), over the 20-year period 1999-2019, and Short Term Statistics (STS), over the 5-year period (2015-2019), for each of the 36 10-daily periods (dekads) of the year. The calculated statistics include the minimum, median, maximum, mean, standard deviation and the number of observations in the covered time series period. These statistics can be used as a reference for actual NDVI observations, which allows monitoring of anomalous vegetation conditions.",
