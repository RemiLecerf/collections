  "description": "Vegetation Phenology and Productivity (VPP) comprise 13 parameters up to 2 seasons that characterize the vegetation growth cycle. It is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) HR-VPP product suite.\n\nA set of 13 Vegetation Phenology and Productivity parameters are derived, for up to two growing seasons. These parameters include the start, end and length of the growing season, the dates when the vegetation index reaches its minimum and maximum values, the maximum value itself and its distance to the minimum (amplitude), the slopes of the green-up and green-down periods and the seasonal and total productivity.\n\nThe Vegetation and Productivity parameters are extracted from the filtered PPI time-series, the HR-VPP Seasonal Trajectories, and hence based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite observations.\n\nThe VPP parameters are made available as a set of raster files with 10 x 10m resolution, in UTM/WGS84 projection corresponding to the Sentinel-2 tiling grid, for those tiles that cover the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom and for the period from 2017 until today, with yearly updates.\n\nThis VPP product is part of the pan-European High Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity (HR-VPP) component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS).",
