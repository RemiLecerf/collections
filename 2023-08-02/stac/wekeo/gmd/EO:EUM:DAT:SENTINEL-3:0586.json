  "description": "The products contain the typical altimetry measurements, like the altimeter range, the sea surface height, the wind speed, significant wave height and all required geophysical corrections and related flags. Also the sea Ice freeboard measurement is included. The measurements in the standard data file provide the measurements in low (1 Hz = approx. 7km) and high resolution (20 Hz = approx. 300 m), in LRM mode or in SAR mode, for both C-band and Ku band. The SAR mode is the default mode. The reduced measurement data file contains 1 Hz measurements only. The enhanced measurement data file contains also the waveforms and associated parameters and the pseudo LRM measurements when in SAR mode. Sentinel-3 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme.\n\nThis collection contains reprocessed data from baseline collection 004. Operational data can be found in the corresponding collection.",
