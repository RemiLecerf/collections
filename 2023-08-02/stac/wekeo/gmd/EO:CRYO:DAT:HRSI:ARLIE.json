  "description": "The Copernicus River and Lake Ice Extent (RLIE) product is generated in near real-time for the entire EEA38 and the United Kingdom based on optical satellite data from the Sentinel-2 constellation (revisit time: 5 days with Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B). The product provides the river and lake area covered by snow-covered or snow-free ice with a spatial resolution of 20 m x 20 m. \n\nThe RLIE is one of the products of the pan-European High-Resolution Snow & Ice service (HR-S&I), which are provided at high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m), and are derived from the Sentinel-2 constellation data. They are generated over the entire EEA38 (32 member countries and 6 cooperating countries) and the United Kingdom, from September 1, 2016 onwards. Four types of HR-S&I products are proposed to users: the Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) product, the Persistent Snow Area (PSA) product, the River and Lake Ice Extent (RLIE) product and the Aggregated River and Lake Ice Extent (ARLIE) product.\n\nEach RLIE product covers an area of 110 km x 110 km with a pixel size of 20 m x 20 m in UTM/WGS84, aligned with the Sentinel-2 input L1C product, over the entire EEA38 and the United Kingdom area and within the EU-Hydro polygon features. Each RLIE product is composed of three separate files corresponding to the different layers of the product, and a metadata file.",
