      <dct:abstract>'''DEFINITION'''

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning strength at 26.5N is obtained by integrating the meridional transport at 26.5 N across the Atlantic basin (zonally) and then doing a cumulative integral in depth. The maximum value in depth is then taken as the strength in Sverdrups (Sv=1x106m3/s). The observations come from the RAPID array (Smeed et al, 2017).    

'''CONTEXT'''

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports heat northwards in the Atlantic and plays a key role in regional and global climate (Srokosz et al, 2012). There is a northwards transport in the upper kilometer resulting from northwards flow in the Gulf Stream and wind-driven Ekman transport, and southwards flow in the ocean interior and in deep western boundary currents (Srokosz et al, 2012). The observations have revealed variability at monthly to decadal timescales including a temporary weakening in 2009/10 (McCarthy et al, 2012) and a decrease from 2005-2012 (Smeed et al, 2014; Smeed et al, 2018). Other studies have suggested that this weakening may be a result of variability (Smeed et al, 2014; Jackson et al 2017).

'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS '''

The AMOC strength exhibits significant variability on many timescales with a temporary weakening in 2009/10. There has been a weakening from 2005-2012 (-0.67 Sv/year, (p=0.03) in the observations and -0.53 Sv/year (p=0.04) in the multi-product mean). The multi-product suggests an earlier increase from 2001-2006 (0.48 Sv/yr, p=0.04), and a weakening in 1998-99, however before this period there is significant uncertainty. This indicates that the changes observed are likely to be variability rather than an ongoing trend (see also Jackson et al, 2018).

Note: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.
