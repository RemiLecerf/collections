      <dct:abstract>The Coastal Zones (CZ) LC/LU product for 2012 is providing a detailed Land Cover / Land Use (LC/ LU) dataset for areas along the coastline of the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom, with reference year 2012 for the classification. This product monitors landscape dynamics in European coastal territory to an inland depth of 10 km with a total area of approximately 730,000 km&#178;, with all the relevant areas (estuaries, coastal lowlands, nature reserves). The production of the coastal zone layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme, as part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Local Component.

The Coastal Zones product covers a buffer zone of coastline derived from EU-Hydro v1.1. Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) layer is extracted from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite data and other available data. The class definitions follow the pre-defined nomenclature on the basis of Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) typology of ecosystems (Level 1 to Level 4) and CORINE Land Cover adapted to the specific characteristics of coastal zones. The classification provides 71 distinct thematic classes with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha and a Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of 10 m. The product is available for the 2012 and 2018 reference year including change mapping. 

This CZ dataset is distributed in vector format, in a single OGC GeoPackage SQLite file covering the area of interest.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Computer assisted visual mapping of LC/LU for reference year 2012. The main dataset for visual image interpretation of reference year 2012 was the DWH_MG2b_CORE_03 dataset (Optical VHR2 coverage over EU 2011-2013), mainly consisting of 1.5m VHR2 SPOT-6 and 2.5m VHR2 SPOT-5 HRG and 2m Pl&#233;iades satellite data. The nomenclature is the basis of the MAES typology of ecosystems adapted to the specific needs of coastal zones monitoring and it is composed by 71 classes.
Positional Accuracy: less than 5 m (according to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA: less than 5m RMSE). Thematic accuracy (area-corrected Overall Accuracy): 97.9%. Accuracy Assessment approach: Stratified Random Point Sampling with 60001 sampling points. Interpretation of sampling points has been performed on the best available reference data.
The Minimum Mapping Unit is 0.5 ha.
The Minimum Mapping Width is 10 m.
