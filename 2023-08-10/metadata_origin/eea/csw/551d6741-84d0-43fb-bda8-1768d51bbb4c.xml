      <dct:abstract>The European Urban Atlas provides reliable, inter-comparable, high-resolution land use maps for 305 Large Urban Zones and their surroundings (more than 100.000 inhabitants as defined by the Urban Audit) for the reference year 2006 in EU member states. The GIS data can be downloaded together with a map for each covered urban area and a report with the metadata for the respective area. Additional information (product description, mapping guidance and class description) can be found at https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/urban-atlas/#tab-methodology.

Urban Atlas is a joint initiative of the European Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy and the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme, with the support of the European Space Agency and the European Environment Agency.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The Urban Atlas is mainly based on the combination of (statistical) image classification and visual interpretation of Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Multispectral SPOT 5 &amp; 6 and Formosat-2 pan-sharpened imagery with a 2 to 2.5m spatial resolution is used as input data. The built-up classes are combined with density information on the level of sealed soil derived from the High Resolution Layer imperviousness to provide more detail in the density of the urban fabric. Finally, the Urban Atlas product is complemented and enriched with functional information (road network, services, utilities etc&#8230;) using ancillary data sources such as local city maps or online map services.
The Minimum Mapping Unit is 0.5 ha. The Minimum Mapping Width is 10 m.</dc:source>
