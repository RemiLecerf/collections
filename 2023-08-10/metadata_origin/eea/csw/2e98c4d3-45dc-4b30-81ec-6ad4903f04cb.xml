      <dct:abstract>This metadata refers to CLMS N2K 2006 product, the Copernicus Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) status map, with 2006 as reference year for the classification, tailored to the needs of biodiversity monitoring in selected Natura2000 sites: 4790 sites of natural and semi-natural grassland formations listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive, including a 2 km buffer zone surrounding the sites and covering an area of 631.820 km&#178; across Europe (EU27, the United Kingdom and Switzerland). The product includes three Emerald sites in Switzerland. LC/LU has been extracted from VHR satellite data and other available data. 
This metadata specifically refers to the revision of the 2006 N2K status map carried out during the production of the 2018 update. 
The production of N2K updates was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Generation of a Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) dataset by visual image interpretation and delineation based on Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite data from 2006 &#177;2 years. Additional in situ and ancillary datasets relevant for the production were also integrated into the workflow to support the LC/LU analysis. During the production of the 2018 update the 2006 status map was revised and improved: thematic and geometric errors were corrected, and thematic accuracy was improved. The classification provides 55 distinct thematic classes. The class definitions follow a pre-defined nomenclature based on the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) typology of ecosystems (at level 1) and are further harmonised with Corine Land Cover and adapted to the specific characteristics of grasslands habitats (levels 2 to 4). The Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is 0.5 ha and the Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) is 10 m. The positional accuracy is less than 5 m (according to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA: less than 5m RMSE). Producer&#8217;s accuracy assessment approach: stratified random point sampling. Interpretation of sampling points was performed on the best available reference data. The overall accuracy is higher than 85%.
