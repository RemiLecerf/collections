      <dct:abstract>The Coastal Zones LC/LU Change (CZC) 2012-2018 is providing the Land Cover / Land Use (LC/ LU) change for areas along the coastline of the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom, between the reference years 2012 and 2018. The Coastal Zones product monitors landscape dynamics in European coastal territory to an inland depth of 10 km with a total area of approximately 730,000 km&#178;, with all the relevant areas (estuaries, coastal lowlands, nature reserves). The production of the coastal zone layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme, as part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Local Component.

The Coastal Zones Change product covers a buffer zone of coastline derived from EU-Hydro v1.1. The Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) Change layer is extracted from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite data and other available data. The reference years for the change are 2012 and 2018. The class definitions follow the pre-defined nomenclature on the basis of Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) typology of ecosystems (Level 1 to Level 4) and CORINE Land Cover adapted to the specific characteristics of coastal zones. The classification provides 71 distinct thematic classes with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha and a Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of 10 m. The status product is available for the 2012 and 2018 reference years. 

This CZC dataset is distributed in vector format, in a single OGC GeoPackage file covering the area of interest.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>Computer assisted visual mapping of LC/LU change between the reference years 2012 and 2018. The main dataset for visual image interpretation of reference year 2012 was the DWH_MG2b_CORE_03 dataset (Optical VHR2 coverage over EU 2011-2013) while for reference year 2018 was the VHR_IMAGE_2018 dataset (Optical VHR coverage of EEA-39 2017-2019), consisting of 2m Pl&#233;iades, Kompsat 3/3A, SuperView-1 and 4m SPOT-6/7, TripleSat, PlanetScope and Deimos satellite data. The nomenclature is the basis of the MAES typology of ecosystems adapted to the specific needs of coastal zones monitoring and it is composed by 71 classes.
Positional Accuracy: less than 5 m (according to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA: less than 5m RMSE). Thematic accuracy (area-corrected Overall Accuracy): 99.6%. Accuracy Assessment approach: Stratified Random Point Sampling with 11619 sampling points. Interpretation of sampling points has been performed on the best available reference data.
The Minimum Mapping Unit is 0.5 ha.
The Minimum Mapping Width is 10 m.
