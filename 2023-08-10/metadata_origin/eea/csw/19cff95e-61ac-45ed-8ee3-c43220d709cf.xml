      <dct:abstract>EU-DEM v1.0 is a digital surface model (DSM) representing the first surface as illuminated by the sensors. It is a hybrid product based on SRTM and ASTER GDEM data fused by a weighted averaging approach and generated as a contiguous dataset divided into 1 degree by 1 degree tiles, corresponding to the SRTM naming convention. The spatial reference system is geographic, lat/lon with horizontal datum ETRS89, ellipsoid GRS80 and vertical datum EVRS2000 with geoid EGG08. These tiles have then been aggregated into 5&#176;x5&#176; tiles which have been projected to ETRS-LAEA by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission.

The implementation of EU-DEM v1.0 was coordinated by the European Commission in 2009-2011 in the framework of the Reference Data Access (RDA) Action of the EU GMES/Copernicus programme.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The EU-DEM v1.0 is derived from an automated data fusion process using SRTM and ASTER GDEM digital surface model (DSM) data. Intermap's NEXTMap Europe dataset is utilized to remove any consistent horizontal bias in the GDEM data. The EU-DEM v1.0 is edited to ensure that water features are adequately represented and consistent with the hydrography layer. Residual clouds within the GDEM data are identified and removed same as suspect data extremely differing from the SRTM data. All EU-DEM tiles are edited interactively in a 3D stereo environment. The editing is restricted to the hydrographical features and pits and bumps. In areas above 60 degrees North, the EU-DEM generation process is supported by other DEM data sources provided by the JRC. Water features are flattened (oceans, lakes) and stepped (rivers) based on the hydrography data. The spatial reference system is geographic, lat/lon with horizontal datum ETRS89, ellipsoid GRS80 and vertical datum EVRS2000 with geoid EGG08.</dc:source>
