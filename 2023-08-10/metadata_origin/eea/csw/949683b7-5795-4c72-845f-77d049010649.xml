      <dct:abstract>The European Urban Atlas provides reliable, inter-comparable, high-resolution land use and land cover change data for 785 Functional Urban Areas (FUA) with more than 50,000 inhabitants between the reference years 2012 and 2018 in EEA38 countries (EU, EFTA, Western Balkan countries as well as T&#252;rkiye) and United Kingdom. The spatial data can be downloaded together with a map for each FUA covered and a report with the metadata for the respective area. The Urban Atlas Change layers have become available as of  2012.

Urban Atlas is a joint initiative of the European Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy and the Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme, with the support of the European Space Agency and the European Environment Agency.

NOTE: By the time of publishing this metadata not all the FUAs were available through the Copernicus Land Service website. The last FUAs were added in January 2021.</dct:abstract>
