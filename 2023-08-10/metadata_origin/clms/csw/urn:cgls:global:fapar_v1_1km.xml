      <dct:abstract>The FAPAR quantifies the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed by plants for photosynthesis. It refers only to the green and living elements of the canopy. The FAPAR depends on the canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties, atmospheric conditions and angular configuration. To overcome this latter dependency, a daily integrated FAPAR value is assessed. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models and is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The input data are the daily Top of the Atmosphere reflectances measured at 1km resolution. They are calibrated, the clouds and their shadows are removed, and they are atmospherically-corrected to get the Top Of the Canopy reflectances. Following the published literature on products validation, the best performing FAPAR products (CYCLOPES, MODIS) were selected and combined to take advantage of their specific performances while limiting the situations where they show deficiencies. The methodology is based upon neural network calibrated over the BELMANIP2 set of sites to relate the fused products to the corresponding atmospherically-corrected and directionally-normalized top of canopy reflectances.</dc:source>
