      <dct:abstract>The Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FCover) corresponds to the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation. 
        Practically, it quantifies the spatial extent of the vegetation. Because it is independent from the 
        illumination direction and it is sensitive to the vegetation amount, FCover is a very good candidate 
        for the replacement of classical vegetation indices for the monitoring of ecosystems.
        The product at 333m resolution is provided in Near Real Time and consolidated in the next six periods.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The input data are the daily Top of the Atmosphere reflectances measured by the sensor at 1/3 km. The calibrated reflectances are used to calculate instantaneous estimates of the products using a neural network trained with MODIS and CYCLOPES products, removing outliers as clouds and their shadows and atmospherically corrected (SMAC). In a second stage these instantaneous first guess of products are composited using an asymmetric period. The compositing is performing a temporal smooth and gap fill operation based on the land cover type (Evergreen Broadleaf Forest or not).</dc:source>
