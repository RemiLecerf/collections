      <dct:abstract>LAI was defined by CEOS as half the developed area of the convex hull wrapping the green canopy elements per unit horizontal ground. This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations will be scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation, it is mandatory to consider all the green layers.         This is particularly important for forest canopies where the understory may represent a very significant contribution to the total canopy LAI. The derived LAI corresponds to the total green LAI, including the contribution of the green elements of the understory.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The input data are the daily Top of the Atmosphere reflectances measured at 1km resolution. They are calibrated, the clouds and their shadows are removed, and they are atmospherically-corrected to get the Top Of the Canopy reflectances. Following the published literature on products validation, the best performing LAI products (CYCLOPES, MODIS) were selected and combined to take advantage of their specific performances while limiting the situations where they show deficiencies. The methodology is based upon neural network calibrated over the BELMANIP2 set of sites to relate the fused products to the corresponding atmospherically-corrected and directionally-normalized top of canopy reflectances.</dc:source>
