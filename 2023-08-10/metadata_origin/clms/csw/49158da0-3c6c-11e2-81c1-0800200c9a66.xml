      <dct:abstract>The Vegetation Condition Indicator (VCI) is a categorical type of difference vegetation index. The VCI compares the observed NDVI to the range of values observed in the same period in previous years. The VCI is expressed in % and gives an idea where the observed value is situated between the extreme values (minimum and maximum) in the previous years. Lower and higher values indicate bad and good vegetation state conditions, respectively.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The input data are the 10-days synthesis of multispectral surface reflectances of  SPOT VEGETATION data and more particular the derived NDVI value together with a historical mean of the NDVI calculated over the period from 1999 till last available full year. The VCI or &#8220;Vegetation Condition Index&#8221; was first proposed by Kogan (1990, 1994, 1995) and is computed as: VCI [%]=100.(NDVI&#8211;NDVImin)/(NDVImax&#8211;NDVImin), with NDVImin and NDVImax the extreme values observed in the previous years (always per pixel and period). The VCI logically varies between 0% and 100%. The lower and higher values respectively indicate bad and good vegetation state conditions, while normal situations have VCI fluctuating around 50%. The VCI is easy to compute and has been used widely in literature, for instance by FAO&#8217;s Agricultural Stress Index System (Rojas et al., 2012). However, VCI-values can sometimes be misleading, because the entire concept is based on the observed extremes, which often might be biased, especially if the used NDVI-series has not been smoothed before.</dc:source>
