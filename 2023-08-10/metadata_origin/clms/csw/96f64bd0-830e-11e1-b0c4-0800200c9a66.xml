      <dct:abstract>BA or Burnt Area products provide temporal pattern information of the fire activity over decades and over seasons. In addition, a seasonality metric provides estimates of the start, peak and end of the fire season within a 1 degree grid. The BA product is generated every 10 days over the entire globe and provided in 10 degree tiles and continents.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The burnt area surfaces are calculated from daily surface reflectances of SPOT VEGETATION sensor. The burnt areas are surfaces which have been sufficiently affected by fire to display significant changes in the vegetation cover (destruction of dry material, reduction or loss of green material) and in the ground surface (temporarily darker because of ash). As fire can occur in any type of environmental context, the properties of the burnt surface may differ significantly from place to place. Therefore their identification is based on a combination of surface's properties and change detection, i.e. differences in spectral properties before and after the fire occurance. The burn detections are provided at 1km resolution, however the seasonality information are calculated per 1x1 degree grid cells (112x112 pixels) and as such provided.</dc:source>
