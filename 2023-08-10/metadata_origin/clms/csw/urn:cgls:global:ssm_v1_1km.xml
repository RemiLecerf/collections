      <dct:abstract>Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is the relative water content of the top few centimetres soil, describing how wet or dry the soil is in its topmost layer, expressed in percent saturation. It is measured by satellite radar sensors and allows insights in local precipitation impacts and soil conditions. 
SSM is a key driver of water and heat fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, regulating air temperature and humidity. Moreover, in its role as water supply, it is vital to vegetation health. Vice versa, SSM is very sensitive to external forcing in the form of precipitation, temperature, solar irradiation, humidity, and wind. SSM is thus both an integrator of climatic conditions and a driver of local weather and climate, and plays a major role in global water-, energy- and carbon- cycles. 
Knowledge on the dynamics of soil moisture is important in the understanding of processes in many environmental and socio-economic fields, e.g., its impact on vegetation vitality, crop yield, droughts or exposure to flood threats.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The SSM algorithm is originally developed at Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and first terrain geo-corrects and radiometrically calibrates the Level-1 Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter values. Then, in the TUWien-Change-Detection model, dry and wet soil conditions are modelled from long term backscatter measurements and the backscatter is normalized to the common reference angle of 40 degrees. The relative surface soil moisture estimates range between 0 and 100 percent and are derived by linearly scaling the angle-normalized backscatter between the lowest/highest backscatter values at each individual location. The relative SSM is provided as percent saturation and can be further translated to absolute volumetric soil moisture by using porosity information.</dc:source>
