      <dct:abstract>The FAPAR quantifies the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed by plants for photosynthesis. It refers only to the green and living elements of the canopy. 
	The FAPAR depends on the canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties, atmospheric conditions and angular configuration.
	To overcome this latter dependency, a daily integrated FAPAR value is assessed. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models and is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).
    The product at 333m resolution is provided in Near Real Time and consolidated in the next six periods.</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The input data are the daily Top of the Atmosphere reflectances measured by the sensor at 1/3 km. The calibrated reflectances are used to calculate instantaneous estimates of the products using a neural network trained with MODIS and CYCLOPES products, removing outliers as clouds and their shadows and atmospherically corrected (SMAC). In a second stage these instantaneous first guess of products are composited using an asymmetric period. The compositing is performing a temporal smooth and gap fill operation based on the land cover type (Evergreen Broadleaf Forest or not).</dc:source>
