      <dct:abstract xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">The dataset provides climate extreme indices related to temperature and precipitation as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), as well as selected heat stress indicators (HSI). The indices are provided for historical and future climate projections (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and used in the 6th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This dataset provides a comprehensive source of pre-calculated and consistent ETCCDI and heat stress indicators commonly used by the climate science and impact communities. The majority of models used in this catalogue entry are now available in the Climate Data Store though the indices offered in this entry additionally include ensemble members obtained from the Earth System Grid Federation.
The indices are calculated from CMIP6 models that have the necessary daily resolved data for both historical and at least two of the future projections. In addition, four of the chosen models contained a large number of ensemble members in order to enable the estimation of the associated uncertainty in the spread of model outcomes when calculating the ETCCDI indices (CanESM5, EC-Earth3, MIROC6 and MPI-ESM1-2-LR). All the ETCCDI indices in this dataset are calculated using the climdex.pcic R package, which was developed, evaluated and approved by the ETCCDI.
To facilitate the usage of heat stress indicators in combination with thresholds on absolute values, this dataset additionally provides bias-adjusted heat stress indicators. Bias adjustment is carried out using the ISIMIP3b bias-adjustment method and employs the WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA5 (WFDE5) dataset as reference. Providing both pre-calculated bias-adjusted data and data without bias adjustment is of great value for climate and impact studies since the calculation of these datasets also are computationally expensive. The WFDE5 dataset is also available in the Climate Data Store.
The heat stress indicators combine near-surface air temperature, near-surface specific humidity, and surface air pressure to give indications of adverse effects of heat on human health. Other variables like wind or solar radiation are not considered, and the selected heat stress indicators thus represent indoor conditions or calm conditions in the shade.
