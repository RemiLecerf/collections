      <dct:abstract xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">The Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis Land (CERRA-Land) dataset provides spatially and temporally consistent historical reconstructions of surface and soil variables at the same horizontal resolution as the CERRA high-resolution reanalysis.
The need for precipitation and surface variables at an ever-increasing spatial and temporal resolution is a recurrent demand. These variables allow, among other things, to address water resource management issues and to carry out climate change impact studies. Regional surface reanalyses are a way to reconstruct these variables for past periods covering several decades using state-of-the-art models. Reanalysis combines model data with observations into a complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where a previous forecast is combined with  newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but usually at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved, reprocessed versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.
The dataset was produced using the CERRA-Land system which consists of a land surface modelling platform SURFEX (V8.1) and a daily (24-h) total accumulated precipitation assimilation system. Most of the data are forecasts generated based on the open-loop integration of the SURFEX. The observations are not directly used in their production but have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing  (e.g. 2m temperature) from the CERRA high-resolution reanalysis and precipitation reanalysis system used to integrate in time the SURFEX model. No downscaling method was used to build up the input forcing data because the CERRA-Land system has the same integration domain (e.g. grid spacing, orography) as the CERRA high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis. SURFEX was run offline, that is without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in the CERRA data assimilation cycles.
To solve both heat and water transfer equations in the soil, a discretisation of the soil into 14 layers was used. The surface precipitation analysis and the 12 snow layers model included in the CERRA-Land system significantly improve the representation of the snowpack over Europe in comparison with the CERRA dataset.
This dataset describes the evolution of soil moisture, soil temperature and snowpack in a consistent view over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5 and ERA5-Land. The temporal and spatial resolutions of CERRA-Land data recommend this dataset, for example, for water resource management and climate change studies.
The added value of the CERRA-Land data with respect to the global reanalysis products is expected to come, for example, with the higher horizontal resolution that permits the usage of a better description of the model topography and physiographic data.
