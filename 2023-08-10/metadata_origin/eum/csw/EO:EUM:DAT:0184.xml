      <dct:abstract xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is the kinetic temperature of a water
          body at a defined depth. Although SLSTR measures an infrared radiometric temperature, it
          is provided as a kinetic temperature by considering the emissivity of the water body as
          part of the SST retrieval process. It is important to note that the SLSTR instruments
          return SST measurements for the ocean 'skin'. Due to the limited penetration of thermal
          infra-red radiation through the water column, this corresponds to the temperature in the
          top few tens of micrometres. At night, the skin temperature is typically a few tenths of a
          degree cooler than the temperature measured by in situ systems; in the day, the skin can
          be considerably higher if strong diurnal warming is present. For more details please see
          &#8220;What is SST?&#8221; on the GHRSST web pages. The SST measurement is obtained by means of a
          highly accurate calibration of the three infra-red channels at 3.74, 10.85 and 12 &#181;m
          (S7-S8-S9). Corrections for water vapour atmospheric absorption are performed using a
          triple window at night, and a split window during the day as the 3.7 &#181;m channel is not
          used due to solar contamination. Each on-ground pixel is viewed twice, via nadir and
          oblique views with different atmospheric path lengths, allowing for correction for aerosol
          effects. Consequently, there are four possible retrieved SSTs, referred to as N2
          (nadir-only 11 &#181;m and 12 &#181;m), N3 (nadir-only 3.7 &#181;m, 11 &#181;m and 12 &#181;m), D2 (dual-view 11 &#181;m
          and 12 &#181;m) and D3 (dual-view 3.7 &#181;m, 11 &#181;m and 12 &#181;m). A fifth retrieval algorithm, N3R is
          similar to N3, but uses the property of &#8220;aerosol robustness&#8221;, which is applicable in areas
          of high atmospheric aerosol content, e.g. near volcanoes. The product is derived from
          SLSTR L2 NRT data following derivation was applied to select the SST pixels to be plotted
          from WST file: - if the observation is in the nadir-only / single-view part of swath (i.e.
          "sst_algorithm_types" is N2, N3, N3R) then SST = sea_surface_temperature - If the
          observation is in the dual-view part of swath ((i.e. "sst_algorithm_types" is D2 or D3)
          then SST = sea_surface_temperature - dual_nadir_sst_difference. Besides, the following
          flags were used to select which pixels to represent and display: (quality_level &gt;=3) and
          (l2p_flags.land == 0) and (l2p_flags.lake == 0) The SLSTR instrument and ground processing
          system are required to produce SST retrievals routinely from the corresponding brightness
          temperatures with an absolute accuracy of better than 0.3 K, globally, both for a single
          sample and when averaged over areas of 0.5&#176; longitude by 0.5&#176; latitude, under certain
          cloud-free conditions (i.e. &gt;20% cloud-free samples within each area). The SLSTR
          instrument also has a temporal stability of 0.1 K/decade.</dct:abstract>
