The dataset is derived from integrating rainfall data included in Climate Data Store with non-climate data to assess soil susceptibility to water erosion according to Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach. The gridded dataset can support the decision-making process of many stakeholders for strategical planning purposes across different sectors addressed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The dataset provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Key information on water erosion dynamics in terms of R factor and potential soil loss for the historical period. The assessment of R factor uses as input gridded observations (E-OBS) and reanalysis data (ERA5, ERA5-Land) for precipitation included in Climate Data Store. The soil loss assessment is obtained by further operating the R factor derived from ERA5-Land with non-climate gridded data representing soil susceptibility to water erosion in accordance to the RUSLE formulation. These are provided at \u2248500m horizontal resolution in this dataset.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key information on water erosion dynamics in terms of R factor and potential soil loss for future periods. The assessment is again based on the RUSLE approach and uses as input precipitation data included in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble climate projections (0.11\u00b0) under several Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In this case, bias-corrected monthly precipitation data are used and the R factor is provided both at native horizontal resolution and regridded to \u2248500m to be operated with other RUSLE factors to derive potential soil loss for the future. Additional R factor proxy variables, based on daily precipitation data, are provided at native horizontal resolution and as anomalies with respect to the historical period, with no bias-correction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Italy</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td><p>High resolution data: remapped datasets are available for R factor and soil loss at 500 m x 500 m resolution for the ERA5-Land and EURO-CORDEX output.</p>\n<p>Native resolution data: the R factor and precipitation variables are provided at the native-resolution for ERA5, ERA5-Land, E-OBS and EURO-CORDEX output.</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td>Surface</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td>Single level</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>1981-2080 (2011-2020 excluded)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td><p>Historical period: single value representing the 30-year period from 1981 to 2010 for R factor and soil loss.
