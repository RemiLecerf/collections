The dataset provides an understanding of European coastal hydrodynamics under the impact of climate change (e.g. sea level rise) and can be used to provide added value to various coastal sectors and studies such as coastal flooding, coastal erosion, harbours and ports. </p>\n<p>To compute these time series, the Deltares Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) version 3.0 is used together with regional climate forcing and sea level rise initial conditions. The regional climate forcing employed is the HIRHAM5 model from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), a member of the EURO-CORDEX climate model ensemble, which is downscaled from the global climate model EC-EARTH. By using a regional climate model and a high-resolution forcing field, GTSM is able to produce a more consistent and high quality dataset. In order to assess the impact of climate change, the GTSM model is run for three different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century often called the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Given that the projections of these climate scenarios are based on a single combination of the regional and global climate models, users of these data should take in consideration that there is an inevitable underestimation of the uncertainty associated with this dataset. In addition to the climate scenarios, a reanalysis dataset is computed by forcing GTSM with ERA5 reanalysis. This provides recent historical water-levels that can be used to look at specific (extreme) events in the past.</p>\n<p>This dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Europe</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td><p>Coastal grid points: 0.1\u00b0</p>\n<p>Ocean grid points: 0.25\u00b0, 0.5\u00b0, and 1\u00b0 within 100 km, 500 km, and &gt;500 km of the coastline, respectively</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td>Surface</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td>Single level</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td><p>ERA5 reanalysis: from 1979 to 2017</p>\n<p>Historical: from 1977 to 2005</p>\n<p>RCP8.5: from 2041 to 2070</p>\n<p>RCP4.5: from 2071 to 2100</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>10 min</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>NetCDF-4</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Conventions</th><td>Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.5</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>No updates expected</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Mean sea level</td><td class='variables-units'>m</td><td class='variables-description'>Mean sea level height relative to the historical mean sea level height (1985-2005).</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Storm surge residual</td><td class='variables-units'>m</td><td class='variables-description'>The storm surge residual is calculated as the difference between the total water level and the tide-only derived water level.
