These variables were computed as a part of a proof of concept contract designed to speed up the workflow in impact assessments and to simplify climate change adaptation of water management practices across Europe.\nThese quantities were modelled using the  Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute E-HYPE, the Wageningen University VIC model and the Joint Research Center Lisflood models. These models work at different resolutions, thus the data is provided at different resolutions. E-HYPE and Lisflood were upscaled in order to show the model ensemble.</p>\n<p>Most variables are provided as averages over 30 year periods, either for each calendar month or for the whole period. \nHowever, for some of the variables, day, percentile and return periods are also provided.</p>\n         <p><i>More details about the products are given in the Documentation section.</i></p>\n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded and catchment</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Pan European domain</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td>Different resolutions: 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0,  0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0 and catchement resolution (215 km<sup>2</sup> in average)</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>Reference period: 1971-2000.
