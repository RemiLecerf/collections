The data cover the Earth on a 80km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 60 levels from the surface up to a height of 0.1 hPa (about 65km).</p>\n<p>ERA-Interim used a numerical weather prediction model that was based on a lower-resolution version of the ECMWF model that was operational in 2006 to assimilate a variety of observations, including satellite and ground-based measurements.</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Projection</th><td><p>Atmosphere and land variables are on a reduced Gaussian grid of N128 (about 80km)</p>\n<p>Ocean wave variables are on a reduced latitude/longitude grid at a resolution of 1.0 degree</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Global: </td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td><p>80km x 80km for atmosphere and land variables (N128)</p>\n<p>1.0 x 1.0 degrees for ocean wave variables </p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical coverage</th><td><p>Near surface or one level for single level variables</p>\n<p>From surface to about 65km for model level variables</p>\n<p>From 1000 hPa to 1 hPa for pressure level variables</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Vertical resolution</th><td><p>60 model levels from 65km to the surface</p>\n<p>37 pressure levels from 1000 to 1 hPa</p>\n<p>16 potential temperature levels from  265 K to 850 K</p>\n<p>1 potential vorticity level at 2 PVU</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>January 1979 to August 2019</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td><p>Analysis variables are availabe 6-hourly</p>\n<p>Forecast variables are availabe 3-hourly</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>GRIB-1</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>None</td></tr>\n</table>\n    </div>",
