This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.</p>\n<p>ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.</p>\n<p>ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.</p>\n<p>The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.\nIt should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.</p>\n<p>An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in <a href=\"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets\" title=\"The family of ERA5 datasets\">this article</a>.\nInformation on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in <a href=\"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5\" title=\"How to download ERA5\">these guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for\nthe uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).\nThere are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).</p>\n<p>The present entry is \"ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present\".</p>\n         \n         \n            <p></p>\n            <table class=\"abstract-description abstract-table\">\n            <tr><th colspan=\"2\">DATA DESCRIPTION</th>\n            \n<tr><th>Data type</th><td>Gridded</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Projection</th><td>Regular latitude-longitude grid</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal coverage</th><td>Global</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Horizontal resolution</th><td><p>Reanalysis: 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 (atmosphere), 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0 (ocean waves)</p>\n<p>Mean, spread and members: 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0 (atmosphere), 1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0 (ocean waves)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal coverage</th><td>1940 to present</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Temporal resolution</th><td>Hourly</td></tr>\n<tr><th>File format</th><td>GRIB</td></tr>\n<tr><th>Update frequency</th><td>Daily</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n    <p></p>\n    <table class=\"abstract-variables abstract-table\">\n    <tr><th colspan=\"3\">MAIN VARIABLES</th>\n    \n\n    <tr><th class='variables-name'>Name</th><th class='variables-units'>Units</th><th class='variables-description'>Description</th></tr>\n    \n<tr><td class='variables-name'>100m u-component of wind</td><td class='variables-units'>m s<sup>-1</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>This parameter is the eastward component of the 100 m wind.

These four parameters are calculated for orographic features  with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being  derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They  are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking  and orographic gravity wave effects.\nThe angle of the sub-grid scale orography characterises the geographical orientation of  the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) relative to an eastwards  axis.\nThis parameter does not vary in time.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Anisotropy of sub-gridscale orography</td><td class='variables-units'>Dimensionless</td><td class='variables-description'>This parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and  angle of sub-gridscale orography) that describe the features of the orography that are  too small to be resolved by the model grid.

Large values  of this parameter (in practice of the order 1) indicate increased probability of the  occurrence of freak waves.\nThe ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights,  lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is  derived from the statistics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. More precisely, it is  the square of the ratio of the integral ocean wave steepness and the relative width of the  frequency spectrum of the waves.\nFurther information on the calculation of this parameter is given in Section 10.6 of the  ECMWF Wave Model documentation.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Boundary layer dissipation</td><td class='variables-units'>J m<sup>-2</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>This parameter is the accumulated conversion of kinetic energy in the mean flow into heat, over the whole atmospheric column, per unit area, that is due to the effects of stress associated with turbulent eddies near the surface and turbulent orographic form drag. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's turbulent diffusion and turbulent orographic form drag schemes. The turbulent eddies near the surface are related to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km, which are specified from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. (The dissipation associated with orographic features with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid-scale is accounted for by the sub-grid orographic scheme.)\nThis parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.

When the boundary layer height is low, higher concentrations of pollutants (emitted from  the Earth's surface) can develop.\nThe boundary layer height calculation is based on the bulk Richardson number (a measure  of the atmospheric conditions) following the conclusions of a 2012 review.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Charnock</td><td class='variables-units'>Dimensionless</td><td class='variables-description'>This parameter accounts for increased aerodynamic roughness as wave heights grow due to  increasing surface stress.

It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane.\nSolar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be  scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the  surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without  being scattered (direct solar radiation).\nClear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions  of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky  quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there.\nThis parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.  For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour ending at the validity date and time.  For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the  3 hours ending at the validity date and time.\nThe units are joules per square metre (J m<sup>-2</sup> ).

If a parcel  of air is more buoyant (warmer and/or with more moisture) than its surrounding  environment, it will continue to rise (cooling as it rises) until it reaches a point  where it no longer has positive buoyancy. CAPE is the potential energy represented by  the total excess buoyancy. The maximum CAPE produced by the different parcels is the  value retained.\nLarge positive values of CAPE indicate that an air parcel would be much warmer than its  surrounding environment and therefore, very buoyant. CAPE is related to the maximum  potential vertical velocity of air within an updraft; thus, higher values indicate  greater potential for severe weather. Observed values in thunderstorm environments  often may exceed 1000 joules per kilogram (J kg<sup>-1),</sup> and in extreme cases may exceed  5000 J kg<sup>-1.</sup>\nThe calculation of this parameter assumes: (i) the parcel of air does not mix with  surrounding air; (ii) ascent is pseudo-adiabatic (all condensed water falls out) and  (iii) other simplifications related to the mixed-phase condensational heating.</td></tr>\n<tr><td class='variables-name'>Convective inhibition</td><td class='variables-units'>J kg<sup>-1</sup></td><td class='variables-description'>This parameter is a measure of the amount of energy required for convection to  commence.
