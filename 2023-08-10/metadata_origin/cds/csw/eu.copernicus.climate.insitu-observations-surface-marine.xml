      <dct:abstract>This set of holdings provides access to surface marine meteorological weather reports and observations made by merchant 
and naval ships, drifting buoys and other platforms and vessels over 
the global ocean. Data have been collated and harmonised and quality control checks have been performed, but no attempt
has been made to assess or correct for potential biases. 
Data are provided for a range of commonly observed variables.
The weather reports contain instantaneous, or point, observations of a number of key Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) 
and other parameters as denoted in the main variables table, made at routine intervals (typically 1, 3, or 6 hourly).
Note that not all reports will contain information for all variables. 
Attributes are described in the related-variables table and users can choose whether to receive all
attributes or solely essential attributes. Data are downloaded as comma-seperated values (CSV) files organised as one 
observation of one variable per row.
The data available is released in the CDS  as version 1 and consist in a reprocessing of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data
Set (ICOADS), Release 3.0 with major improvements made to the quality control and duplicate flagging of observations and
improved availability of metadata. The current release represents a preliminary reprocessing of the period 1851-2010,
with additional data and flags planned to be added in subsequent releases. 
Users should ensure an appropriate assessment of long-term data quality prior to use in those applications which require
consideration of such aspects. Users should be aware that data availability is spatio-temporally incomplete and varies 
significantly throughout the period of record.
More details about the marine data holdings are available in the product user guide, and details around data formatting 
can be found in the common data model documentation, both of which can be found in the documentation section.
This work is being completed on behalf of Copernicus Climate Change Services in sustained collaboration with colleagues
at NOAA's National Centres for Environmental Information who are the WMO designated World Data Centre for meteorology.

Variables in the dataset/application are:
Air pressure at sea level, Air temperature, Dew point temperature, Water temperature, Wind from direction, Wind speed

Variables in the dataset/application are:
Data policy licence, Date time, Date time meaning, Height above surface, Latitude, Longitude, Observation duration, Observation id, Observation value, Observed variable, Platform type, Primary station id, Quality flag, Report type, Station name, Station type, Units, Value significance</dct:abstract>
