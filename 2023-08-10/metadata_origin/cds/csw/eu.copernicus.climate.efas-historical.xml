      <dct:abstract>This dataset provides gridded modelled sub-daily and daily hydrological time series forced with meteorological observations. The data set is a consistent representation of the most important hydrological variables across the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) domain. The temporal resolution is up to 30 years modelled time series of:

River discharge
Soil moisture for three soil layers
Snow water equivalent

Also provided are auxiliary (time invariant) data to aid interpretation of river discharge and soil moisture data. These auxiliary data are the upstream area, elevation, soil depth, wilting capacity and field capacity. The latter three are provided at three soil levels, one for each of the three soil layers represented in LISFLOOD.
This dataset was produced by forcing the open-source LISFLOOD hydrological model with gridded observational data of precipitation and temperature at a 5x5 km resolution across the EFAS domain. The pre-release of v5.0 has a 1x1 arcminute resolution (~1.5 km at EFAS latitudes) across the EFAS domain. For v4.0 data is available from 1991-01-01 up until near-real time, with a delay of 6 days. The real-time data is only available to EFAS partners.
Companion datasets, also available through the CDS, are forecasts for users who are looking medium-range forecasts, reforecasts for research, local skill assessment and post-processing, and seasonal forecasts and reforecasts for users looking for long-term forecasts. For users looking for global hydrological data, we refer to the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) forecasts and historical simulations.
All these datasets are part of the operational flood forecasting within the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which is managed, technically implemented and developed by the European Commission&#8217;s Joint Research Centre.

Variables in the dataset/application are:
River discharge in the last 24 hours, River discharge in the last 6 hours, Snow depth water equivalent, Volumetric soil moisture

Variables in the dataset/application are:
Elevation, Field capacity, Soil depth, Upstream area, Wilting point</dct:abstract>
