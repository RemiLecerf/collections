      <dct:abstract>The UERRA dataset provides estimations of the climate in Europe based on model data
combined with observations using the UERRA-HARMONIE system and MESCAN-SURFEX system.
UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional data assimilation system, whereas
MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. In general, the
assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to
sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates
at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each
grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always
using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset
to work with.
The land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from
UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without
feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE
data assimilation cycles.
The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the
assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks
will have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate
estimates. The improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the
higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography).
Moreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.

Variables in the dataset/application are:
Soil temperature, Volumetric soil moisture, Volumetric transpiration stress-onset, Volumetric wilting point</dct:abstract>
