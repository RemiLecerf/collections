  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nThe CDR and ICDR sea ice concentration dataset of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF (OSI-450 and OSI-430-b), covering the period from January 1979 to present, with 16 days delay. It used passive microwave data from SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS. Sea ice concentration is computed from atmospherically corrected PMW brightness temperatures, using a combination of state-of-the-art algorithms and dynamic tie-points. It includes error-bars for each grid cell (uncertainties). This version 2.0 of the dataset was released in mid-2017 (CDR, OSI-450, 1979-2015) and mid-2019 (ICDR, OSI-430-b, 2016-present).\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00136",
