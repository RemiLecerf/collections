  "description": "Gross dry matter Productivity (GDMP) is an indication of the overall growth rate or dry biomass increase of the vegetation and is directly related to ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), that reflects the ecosystem's overall production of organic compounds from atmospheric carbon dioxide, however its units (kilograms of gross dry matter per hectare per day) are customized for agro-statistical purposes. Like the FAPAR products that are used as input for the GDMP estimation, these GDMP products are provided in Near Real Time, with consolidations in the next periods, or as offline product.",
