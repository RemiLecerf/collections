  "description": "The TROPOMI instrument is a space-borne, nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument, the single payload of the Sentinel-5P spacecraft, uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. The instrument operates in a push-broom configuration (non-scanning), with a swath width of ~2600 km on the Earth's surface. The typical pixel size (near nadir) will be 7x3.5 km2 for all spectral bands, with the exception of the UV1 band (7x28 km2) and SWIR bands (7x7 km2).",
