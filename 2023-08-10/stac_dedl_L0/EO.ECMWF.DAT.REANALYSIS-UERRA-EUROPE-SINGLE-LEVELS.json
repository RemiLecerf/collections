  "description": "This UERRA dataset contains analyses of surface and near-surface essential climate variables from\nUERRA-HARMONIE and MESCAN-SURFEX systems. Forecasts up to 30 hours initialised\nfrom the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available only through the CDS-API (see Documentation).\nUERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system,\nwhile MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system.\nUsing the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation\nand six-hourly air temperature and relative humidity at 2 meters above the model topography.\nThe land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses.\nIt is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data\nassimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows to take full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more\nadvanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and\nsurface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow.\nIn general, the assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality\ndata from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of\nestimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format,\nmakes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system\ncan resolve data holes, the much sparser observational networks, e.g. in 1960s,\nwill have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates.\nThe improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution\nthat allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables\nthe system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\n10m wind direction, 10m wind speed, 2m relative humidity, 2m temperature, Albedo, High cloud cover, Land sea mask, Low cloud cover, Mean sea level pressure, Medium cloud cover, Orography, Skin temperature, Snow density, Snow depth water equivalent, Surface pressure, Surface roughness, Total cloud cover, Total column integrated water vapour, Total precipitation",
