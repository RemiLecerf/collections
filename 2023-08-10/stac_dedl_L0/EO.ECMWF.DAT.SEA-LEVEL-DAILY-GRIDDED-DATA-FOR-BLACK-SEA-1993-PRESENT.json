  "description": "Sea level anomaly is the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. Up-to-date altimeter standards are used to estimate the sea level anomalies with a mapping algorithm dedicated to the Black sea region. Anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012).\nThe steady number of reference satellite used in the production of this dataset contributes to the long-term stability of the sea level record. Improvements of the accuracy, sampling of meso-scale processes and of the high-latitude coverage were achieved by using a few additional satellite missions.\nNew data are provided with a delay of about 4-5 months relatively to near-real time or interim sea level products. This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, this processing and validation adds stability and accuracy to the sea level variables and make them adapted to climate applications.\nThis dataset includes uncertainties for each grid cell. More details about the sea level retrieval, additional filters, optimisation procedures, and the error estimation are given in the Documentation section.\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nAbsolute dynamic topography, Absolute geostrophic velocity meridian component, Absolute geostrophic velocity zonal component, Geostrophic velocity anomalies meridian component, Geostrophic velocity anomalies zonal component, Sea level anomaly",
