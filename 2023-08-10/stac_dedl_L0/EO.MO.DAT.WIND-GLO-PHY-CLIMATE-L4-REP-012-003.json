  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the Global Ocean - The product contains monthly Level-4 sea surface wind and stress fields at 0.25 degrees horizontal spatial resolution. The monthly averaged wind and stress fields are based on monthly average ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis fields, corrected for persistent biases using all available Level-3 scatterometer observations from the Metop-A, Metop-B and Metop-C ASCAT satellite instruments.  The product provides monthly mean stress-equivalent wind and stress variables as well as their standard deviation. The number of observations used to calculate the monthly averages are included in the product.\"\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00181",
