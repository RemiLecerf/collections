  "description": "Burnt Area products map burn scars, surfaces which have been sufficiently affected by fire to display significant changes in the vegetation cover (destruction of dry material, reduction or loss of green material) and in the ground surface (temporarily darker because of ash). As fire can occur in any type of environmental context, the properties of the burnt surface may differ significantly from place to place. Therefore their identification is based on a combination of surface's properties and change detection, i.e. differences in spectral properties before and after the fire occurance. The burnt area detections are provided at 333 m resolution.",
