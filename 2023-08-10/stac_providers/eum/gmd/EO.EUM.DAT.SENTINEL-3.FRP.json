  "description": "The Copernicus NRT S3 FRP product identifies the location, and quantifies the radiative power, of any hotspot present on land and ocean Earth surfaces, that radiates a heating signal within a pixel size of 1 km2\nAll threatening hotspots are identified and characterised within three hours from SLSTR observation sensing time.\nThe current version of the NRT S3 FRP processor is mainly applicable during the night while only a few daytime granules, with non-saturated background (i.e. no fires) radiance, are processed at this stage. The NRT S3 FRP product will become operational after a higher level of quality and maturity is reached, including the full processing of granules during daytime, a comprehensive global validation, and positive feedback by experts and users.",
