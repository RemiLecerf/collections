  "description": "'''Short description:''' \n\nFor the Global - Arctic and Antarctic - Ocean. The OSI SAF delivers three global sea ice products in operational mode: sea ice concentration, sea ice edge, sea ice type (OSI-401 OSI-402 and OSI-403). These products are delivered daily at 10km resolution in a polar stereographic projection covering the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. It is the Sea Ice operational nominal product for the Global Ocean. In addition, a sea ice drift product is delivered at 60km resolution in a polar stereographic projection covering the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The sea ice motion vectors have a time-span of 2 days.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00134",
