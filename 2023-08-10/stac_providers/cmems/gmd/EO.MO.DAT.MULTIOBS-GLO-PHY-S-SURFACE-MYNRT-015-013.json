  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nThis product consits of global gap-free Level-4 (L4) analyses of the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and Sea Surface Density (SSD) obtained through a multivariate optimal interpolation algorithm that combines sea surface salinity images from multiple satellite sources as NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and ESA’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites with in situ salinity measurements and satellite SST information. The product was developed by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) and includes 4 datasets:\n* dataset-sss-ssd-nrt-weekly, which delivers near-real-time (NRT) weekly data\n* dataset-sss-ssd-nrt-monthly, which delivers near-real-time (NRT) monthly data\n* dataset-sss-ssd-rep-weekly, which delivers multi-year reprocessed (REP) weekly data \n* dataset-sss-ssd-rep-monthly, which delivers multi-year reprocessed (REP) monthly data \n\n'''Product citation''': \n\nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products: http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169.\n\n'''DOI (product) :''' \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00051",
