  "description": "'''Short description:''' \n\nFor the Global Ocean - The product contains daily L3 gridded sea surface wind observations from available scatterometers with resolutions corresponding  to the L2 swath products:\n*0.5 degrees grid for the 50 km scatterometer L2 inputs,\n*0.25 degrees grid based on 25 km scatterometer swath observations,\n*and 0.125 degrees based on 12.5 km scatterometer swath observations, i.e., from the coastal products. Data from ascending and descending passes are gridded separately. \n\nThe reported wind is stress-equivalent wind with wind stress, wind stress curl and divergence. The REP L3 products follow the REP availability of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF L2 products and are available for: The ASCAT scatterometer on MetOp-A and Metop-B at 0.125 and 0.25 degrees; The Seawinds scatterometer on QuikSCAT at 0.25 and 0.5 degrees; The AMI scatterometer on ERS-1 and ERS-2 at 0.25 degrees; The OSCAT scatterometer on Oceansat-2 at 0.25 and 0.5 degrees;\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00183",
