  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the Global Ocean - The product contains daily L3 gridded sea surface wind observations from available scatterometers with resolutions corresponding to the L2 swath products:\n\n*0.5 degrees grid for the 50 km scatterometer L2 inputs,\n*0.25 degrees grid based on 25 km scatterometer swath observations,\n*and 0.125 degrees based on 12.5 km scatterometer swath observations, i.e., from the coastal products.\n\nData from ascending and descending passes are gridded separately.\nThe reported wind is stress-equivalent wind and wind stress. Moreover, wind stress curl and divergence are also available. The NRT L3 products follow the NRT availability of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF L2 products and are available for:\n*The ASCAT scatterometers on Metop-A (discontinued on 15/11/2021), Metop-B and Metop-C at 0.125 and 0.25 degrees;\n*The OSCAT scatterometer on Scatsat-1 at 0.25 and 0.5 degrees (discontinued on 28/2/2021); \n*The HSCAT scatterometer on HY-2B, HY-2C and HY-2D at 0.25 and 0.5 degrees\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00182",
