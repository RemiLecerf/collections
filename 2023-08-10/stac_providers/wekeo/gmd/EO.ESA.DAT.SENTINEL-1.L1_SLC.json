  "description": "Sentinel-1 is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services. \t\t\t\tThe first Sentinel-1 satellite was launched on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on 3 April 2014.    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLevel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products consist of focused SAR data geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite and provided in zero-Doppler slant-range geometry. The products include a single look in each dimension using the full TX signal bandwidth and consist of complex samples preserving the phase information.",
