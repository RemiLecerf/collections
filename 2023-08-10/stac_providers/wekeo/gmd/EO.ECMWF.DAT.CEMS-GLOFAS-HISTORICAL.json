  "description": "This dataset contains global modelled daily data of river discharge from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), which is part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). River discharge, or river flow as it is also known, is defined as the amount of water that flows through a river section at a given time. \nThis dataset is simulated by forcing a hydrological modelling chain with inputs from a global reanalysis. Data availability for the historical simulation is from 1979-01-01 up to near real time.\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nRiver discharge in the last 24 hours\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nUpstream area",
