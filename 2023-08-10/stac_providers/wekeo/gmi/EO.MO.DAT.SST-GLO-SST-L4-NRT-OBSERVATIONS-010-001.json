  "description": "'''Short description:''' \n\nFor the Global Ocean- the OSTIA global foundation Sea Surface Temperature product provides daily gap-free maps of : Foundation Sea Surface Temperature at 0.05° x 0.05° horizontal grid resolution, using in-situ and satellite data from both infrared and microwave radiometers; Sea Surface Temperature anomaly from the Pathfinder climatology at 0.25° x 0.25° horizontal resolution; Estimates of SST bias in data from satellites contributing to the OSTIA SST analysis at 0.25° x 0.25° horizontal resolution. \n\nThe Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system is run by the UK's Met Office. OSTIA uses satellite data provided by the GHRSST project together with in-situ observations to determine the sea surface temperature.\nA high resolution (1/20° - approx. 6 km) daily analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) is produced for the global ocean and some lakes. SST anomalies are calculated at 1/4° resolution from the daily Pathfinder climatology. As part of the analysis procedure, an estimate of the bias in the contributing satellite sensors is made. This is done by calculating match-ups between each satellite sensor and a reference data-set (currently comprised of drifting and moored buoy in situ data and nighttime VIIRS and dual-view SLSTR satellite SSTs). These differences are then analysed to produce gridded fields of bias for each sensor.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00165",
