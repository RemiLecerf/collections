  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the Global Ocean - The product contains hourly Level-4 sea surface wind and stress fields at 0.125 and 0.25 degrees horizontal spatial resolution. Scatterometer observations and their collocated European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis model variables are used to calculate temporally-averaged difference fields. These fields are used to correct for persistent biases in hourly ECMWF ERA5 model fields. Bias corrections are based on scatterometer observations from Metop-A, Metop-B, Metop-C ASCAT (0.125 degrees) and QuikSCAT SeaWinds (0.25 degrees). The product provides stress-equivalent wind and stress variables as well as their divergence and curl. The applied bias corrections, the standard deviation of the differences (for wind and stress fields) and difference of variances (for divergence and curl fields) are included in the product.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00185",
