  "description": "'''Short description:'''\nThe IBI-MFC provides a high-resolution biogeochemical analysis and forecast product covering the European waters, and more specifically the Iberia–Biscay–Ireland (IBI) area. The last 2 years before now (historic best estimates) as well as daily averaged forecasts with a horizon of 10 days (updated on a weekly basis) are available on the catalogue.\nTo this aim, an online coupled physical-biogeochemical operational system is based on NEMO-PISCES at 1/36° and adapted to the IBI area, being Mercator-Ocean in charge of the model code development. PISCES is a model of intermediate complexity, with 24 prognostic variables. It simulates marine biological productivity of the lower trophic levels and describes the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and of the main nutrients (P, N, Si, Fe).\nThe product provides daily and monthly averages of the main biogeochemical variables:  chlorophyll, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, iron, ammonium, net primary production, euphotic zone depth, phytoplankton carbon, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and zooplankton.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.[http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169]\n\n'''DOI (Product)''': \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00026",
