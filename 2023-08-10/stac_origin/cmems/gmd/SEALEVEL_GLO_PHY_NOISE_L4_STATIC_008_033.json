  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nIn wavenumber spectra, the 1hz measurement error is the noise level estimated as the mean value of energy at high wavenumbers (below ~20km in term of wavelength). The 1hz noise level spatial distribution follows the instrumental white-noise linked to the Surface Wave Height but also connections with the backscatter coefficient. The full understanding of this hump of spectral energy (Dibarboure et al., 2013, Investigating short wavelength correlated errors on low-resolution mode altimetry, OSTST 2013 presentation) still remain to be achieved and overcome with new retracking, new editing strategy or new technology.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00144",
