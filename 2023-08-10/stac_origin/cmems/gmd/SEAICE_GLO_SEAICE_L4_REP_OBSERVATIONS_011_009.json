  "description": "'''Short description:''' \nThe CDR and ICDR sea ice concentration dataset of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF (OSI-450-a and OSI-430-a), covering the period from October 1978 to present, with 16 days delay. It used passive microwave data from SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS. Sea ice concentration is computed from atmospherically corrected PMW brightness temperatures, using a combination of state-of-the-art algorithms and dynamic tie points. It includes error bars for each grid cell (uncertainties). This version 3.0 of the CDR (OSI-450-a, 1978-2020) and ICDR (OSI-430-a, 2021-present with 16 days latency) was released in November 2022\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00136",
