  "description": "'''Short description:''' \nFor the Mediterranean Sea (MED), the CNR MED Sea Surface Temperature (SST) processing chain provides daily gap-free (L4) maps at high (HR 0.0625째) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01째) spatial resolution over the Mediterranean Sea. Remotely-sensed L4 SST datasets are operationally produced and distributed in near-real time by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Gruppo di Oceanografia da Satellite (CNR-GOS). These SST products are based on the nighttime images collected by the infrared sensors mounted on different satellite platforms, and cover the Southern European Seas. The CNR-GOS processing chain includes several modules, from the data extraction and preliminary quality control, to cloudy pixel removal and satellite images collating/merging. A two-step algorithm finally allows to interpolate SST data at high (HR 0.0625째) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01째) spatial resolution, applying statistical techniques. These L4 data are also used to estimate the SST anomaly with respect to a pentad climatology. The basic design and the main algorithms used are described in the following papers.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00172",
