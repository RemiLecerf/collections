  "description": "'''DEFINITION'''\n\nOcean heat content (OHC) is defined here as the deviation from a reference period (1993-2014) and is closely proportional to the average temperature change from z1 = 0 m to z2 = 700 m depth:\nOHC=∫_(z_1)^(z_2)ρ_0  c_p (T_yr-T_clim )dz \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1]\nwith a reference density of = 1030 kgm-3 and a specific heat capacity of cp = 3980 J kg-1 °C-1 (e.g. von Schuckmann et al., 2009).\nTime series of annual mean values area averaged ocean heat content is provided for the Mediterranean Sea (30°N, 46°N; 6°W, 36°E) and is evaluated for topography deeper than 300m.\n\n'''CONTEXT'''\n\nKnowing how much and where heat energy is stored and released in the ocean is essential for understanding the contemporary Earth system state, variability and change, as the oceans shape our perspectives for the future.\nThe quality evaluation of MEDSEA_OMI_OHC_area_averaged_anomalies is based on the “multi-product” approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (von Schuckmann et al., 2018), and following the MyOcean’s experience (Masina et al., 2017). \nSix global products and a regional (Mediterranean Sea) product have been used to build an ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread. The reference products are:\n\tThe Mediterranean Sea Reanalysis at 1/24 degree horizontal resolution (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004, DOI: https://doi.org/10.25423/CMCC/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004_E3R1, Escudier et al., 2020)\n\tFour global reanalyses at 1/4 degree horizontal resolution (GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_031): \nGLORYS, C-GLORS, ORAS5, FOAM\n\tTwo observation based products: \nCORA (INSITU_GLO_TS_REP_OBSERVATIONS_013_001_b) and \nARMOR3D (MULTIOBS_GLO_PHY_TSUV_3D_MYNRT_015_012). \nDetails on the products are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI. \n\n'''CMEMS KEY FINDINGS'''\n\nThe ensemble mean ocean heat content anomaly time series over the Mediterranean Sea shows a continuous increase in the period 1993-2019 at rate of 1.4±0.3 W/m2 in the upper 700m. After 2005 the rate has clearly increased with respect the previous decade, in agreement with Iona et al. (2018).\n\n'''DOI (product):''' \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00261",
