  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nThis product consists of vertical profiles of the concentration of nutrients (nitrates, phosphates, and silicates) and carbonate system variables (total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide), computed for each Argo float equipped with an oxygen sensor.\nThe method called CANYON (Carbonate system and Nutrients concentration from hYdrological properties and Oxygen using a Neural-network) is based on a neural network trained using high-quality nutrient data collected over the last 30 years (GLODAPv2 database, https://www.glodap.info/). The method is applied to each Argo float equipped with an oxygen sensor using as input the properties measured by the float (pressure, temperature, salinity, oxygen), and its date and position.\n\n'''Product Citation:''' Please refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products: http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00048",
