  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n \nThe GLORYS12V1 product is the CMEMS global ocean eddy-resolving (1/12° horizontal resolution, 50 vertical levels) reanalysis covering the altimetry (1993 onward).\n\nIt is based largely on the current real-time global forecasting CMEMS system. The model component is the NEMO platform driven at surface by ECMWF ERA-Interim then ERA5 reanalyses for recent years. Observations are assimilated by means of a reduced-order Kalman filter. Along track altimeter data (Sea Level Anomaly), Satellite Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Ice Concentration and In situ Temperature and Salinity vertical Profiles are jointly assimilated. Moreover, a 3D-VAR scheme provides a correction for the slowly-evolving large-scale biases in temperature and salinity.\n\nThis product includes daily and monthly mean files for  temperature, salinity, currents, sea level, mixed layer depth and ice parameters from the top to the bottom. The global ocean output files are displayed on a standard regular grid at 1/12° (approximatively 8 km) and on 50 standard levels.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021",
