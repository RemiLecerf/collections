  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the NWS/IBI Ocean- Sea Surface Temperature L3 Observations . This product provides daily foundation sea surface temperature from multiple satellite sources. The data are intercalibrated. This product consists in a fusion of sea surface temperature observations from multiple satellite sensors, daily, over a 0.05° resolution grid. It includes observations by polar orbiting from the ESA CCI / C3S archive .  The L3S SST data are produced selecting only the highest quality input data from input L2P/L3P images within a strict temporal window (local nightime), to avoid diurnal cycle and cloud contamination. The observations of each sensor are intercalibrated prior to merging using a bias correction based on a multi-sensor median reference correcting the large-scale cross-sensor biases.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00311",
