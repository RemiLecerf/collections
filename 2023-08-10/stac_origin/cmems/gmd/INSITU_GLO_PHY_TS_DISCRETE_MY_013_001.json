  "description": "'''Short description:'''\nFor the Global Ocean- In-situ observation yearly delivery in delayed mode. The In Situ delayed mode product designed for reanalysis purposes integrates the best available version of in situ data for temperature and salinity measurements. These data are collected from main global networks (Argo, GOSUD, OceanSITES, World Ocean Database) completed by European data provided by EUROGOOS regional systems and national system by the regional INS TAC components. It is updated on a yearly basis. This version is a merged product between the previous verion of CORA and EN4 distributed by the Met Office  for the period 1950-1990.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''  \nhttps://doi.org/10.17882/46219",
