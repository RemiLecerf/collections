  "description": "'''Short description:''' \n\nBLKSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_007_010 is the nominal product of the Black Sea Biogeochemistry NRT system and is generated by the NEMO 4.0-BAMHBI modelling system. Biogeochemical Model for Hypoxic and Benthic Influenced areas (BAMHBI) is an innovative biogeochemical model with a 28-variable pelagic component (including the carbonate system) and a 6-variable benthic component ; it explicitely represents processes in the anoxic layer.\nThe product provides analysis and forecast for 3D concentration of chlorophyll, nutrients (nitrate and phosphate), dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton carbon biomass, net primary production, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and for 2D fields of bottom oxygen concentration (for the North-Western shelf), surface partial pressure of CO2 and surface flux of CO2. These variables are computed on a grid with ~3km x 59-levels resolution, and are provided as daily and monthly means.\n\n'''Product Citation:''' \n\nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''  \nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/cmcc/blksea_analysisforecast_bgc_007_010",
