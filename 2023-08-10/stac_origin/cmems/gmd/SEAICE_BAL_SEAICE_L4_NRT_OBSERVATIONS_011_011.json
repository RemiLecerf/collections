  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the Baltic Sea - The operational sea ice service at FMI provides ice parameters over the Baltic Sea. The products are based on SAR images and are produced on pass-by-pass basis during the Baltic Sea ice season, and show the ice thickness and drift in a 500 m and 800m grid, respectively.  The Baltic sea ice concentration product is based on data from SAR and microwave radiometer. The algorithm uses SENTINEL-1 SAR EW mode dual-polarized HH/HV data combined with AMSR2 radiometer data.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00133",
