  "description": "'''Short description:'''\nThe IBI-MFC provides a biogeochemical reanalysis product for the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland (IBI) area starting in 01/01/1993 and being regularly updated on a yearly basis. The model system is run by Mercator-Ocean, being the product post-processed to the user’s format by Nologin with the support of CESGA in terms of supercomputing resources.\nTo this aim, an application of the biogeochemical model PISCES is run simultaneously with the ocean physical IBI reanalysis, generating both products at the same 1/12° horizontal resolution. The PISCES model is able to simulate the first levels of the marine food web, from nutrients up to mesozooplankton and it has 24 state variables.\nThe product provides daily, monthly and yearly averages of the main biogeochemical variables:  chlorophyll, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, iron, ammonium, net primary production, euphotic zone depth, phytoplankton carbon, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon and surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Additionally, climatological parameters (monthly mean and standard deviation) of these variables for the period 1993-2016 are delivered.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.[http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169]\n\n'''DOI (Product)''': \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00029",
