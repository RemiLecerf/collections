  "description": "A glacier is defined as a perennial mass of ice, and possibly firn and snow, originating on the land surface from the recrystallization of snow or other forms of solid precipitation and showing evidence of past or present flow. There are several types of glaciers such as glacierets, mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and ice fields, as well as ice caps. Some glacier tongues reach into lakes or the sea, and can develop floating ice tongues or ice shelves. Glacier changes are recognized as independent and high-confidence natural indicators of climate change. Past, current and future glacier changes affect global sea level, the regional water cycle and local hazards.\nThis dataset is a snapshot of global glacier outlines compiled from\nmaps, aerial photographs and satellite images mostly acquired in the period 2000-2010.",
