The processing focuses on the stability and homogeneity of the sea level record (based on a stable two-satellite constellation) and the product is dedicated to the monitoring of the sea level long-term evolution for climate applications and the analysis of Ocean/Climate indicators. These products are produced and distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S, https://climate.copernicus.eu/).\n\n'''DOI (product):'''\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00145",
