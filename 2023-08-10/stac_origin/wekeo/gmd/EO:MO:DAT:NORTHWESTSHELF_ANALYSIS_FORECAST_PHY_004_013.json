  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nThe ocean physics analysis and forecast for the North-West European Shelf is produced using a forecasting ocean assimilation model, with tides, at 1.5 km horizontal resolution coupled with a wave model.\nThe ocean model is NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean), using the 3DVar NEMOVAR system to assimilate observations. These are surface temperature, vertical profiles of temperature and salinity, and along track satellite sea level anomaly data. The model is forced by lateral boundary conditions from the UK Met Office North Atlantic Ocean forecast model and by the CMEMS Baltic forecast product [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=BALTICSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_003_006 BALTICSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_003_006]. The atmospheric forcing is given by the operational ECMWF Numerical Weather Prediction model. The river discharge is from a daily climatology. Further details of the model, including the product validation are provided in the [http://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-NWS-QUID-004-013.pdf CMEMS-NWS-QUID-004-013]. The wave model is described in [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=NORTHWESTSHELF_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_004_014 NORTHWESTSHELF_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_004_014].\nProducts are provided as hourly instantaneous, quarter-hourly, and daily 25-hour, de-tided, averages. The datasets available are temperature, salinity, horizontal currents, sea level, mixed layer depth, and bottom temperature. Temperature, salinity and currents, as multi-level variables, are interpolated from the model 51 hybrid s-sigma terrain-following system to 33 standard geopotential depths (z-levels) and from the model rotated grid to a regular lat-lon grid.\nThe product is updated daily, providing a 6-day forecast and the previous 2-day assimilative hindcast.
