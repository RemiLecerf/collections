This Multi-Year product is processed by the WAVE-TAC multi-mission altimeter data processing system and is based on CMEMS Multi-Year level-3 SWH datasets (see the product WAVE_GLO_PHY_SWH_L3_MY_014_005).\nIt merges along-track SWH data from the following missions: Jason-1, Jason-2, Envisat, Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, Jason-3 and CFOSAT. The resulting gridded product has a 2Â° horizontal resolution and is produced daily. Different SWH fields are produced: VAVH_DAILY fields are daily statistics computed from all available level 3 along-track measurements from 00 UTC until 23:59 UTC ; VAVH_INST field provides an estimate of the instantaneous wave field at 12:00UTC (noon), using all available Level 3 along-track measurements and accounting for their spatial and temporal proximity.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00177",
