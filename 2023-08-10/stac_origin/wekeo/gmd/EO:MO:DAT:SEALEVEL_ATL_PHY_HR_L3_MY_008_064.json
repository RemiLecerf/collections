  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nExperimental altimeter satellite along-track sea surface heights anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year [1993, 2012] mean with a 5Hz (~1.3km) sampling. All the missions are homogenized with respect to a reference mission (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr [http://duacs.cls.fr] pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (e.g. Mean Dynamic Topography, Dynamic Atmosphic Correction, Ocean Tides, Long Wavelength Errors, Internal tide, â€¦) that can be used to change the physical content for specific needs\nThis product was generated as experimental products in a CNES R&D context. It was processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00137",
