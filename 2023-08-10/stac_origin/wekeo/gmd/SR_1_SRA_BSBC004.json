When the altimeter is in SAR mode, this product also contains the so-called Pseudo LRM (PLRM) echoes. Complex (In-phase and Quadrature) echoes (I's and Q;s) after slant/Doppler range correction. This product is most relevant to geophysical retrieval algorithm developers (over ocean, land and ice surfaces), surface characterisations studies (e.g. impact of sea state bias, wave directional effects etc) and Quality Control systems. Sentinel-3 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme.\n\nThis collection contains reprocessed data from baseline collection 004. Operational data can be found in the corresponding collection.",
