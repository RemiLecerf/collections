  "description": "Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the radiative skin temperature over land. LST plays an important role in the physics of land surface as it is involved in the processes of energy and water exchange with the atmosphere. LST is useful for the scientific community, namely for those dealing with meteorological and climate models. Accurate values of LST are also of special interest in a wide range of areas related to land surface processes, including meteorology, hydrology, agrometeorology, climatology and environmental studies.",
