Each pixel is classified as one of the following four types: clear sky over water, clear sky over land, cloud, or not processed (off Earth disc). Applications & Uses: The main use is in support of Nowcasting applications, where it frequently serves as a basis for other cloud products, and the remote sensing of continental and ocean surfaces.\n\nFrom 1 June 2022, Meteosat-9 at 45.5° E is the prime satellite for the IODC service, replacing Meteosat-8 (located at 41.5° E while in operation).",
