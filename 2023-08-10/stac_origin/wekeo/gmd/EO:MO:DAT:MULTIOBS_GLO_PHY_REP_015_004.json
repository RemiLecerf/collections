  "description": "'''Short description:'''\n\nThis product is a REP L4 global total velocity field at 0m and 15m. It consists of the zonal and meridional velocity at a 3h frequency and at 1/4 degree regular grid. These total velocity fields are obtained by combining CMEMS REP satellite Geostrophic surface currents and modelled Ekman currents at the surface and 15m depth (using ECMWF ERA5 wind stress). 3 hourly product, daily and monthly means are available. This product has been initiated in the frame of CNES/CLS projects. Then it has been consolidated during the Globcurrent project (funded by the ESA User Element Program).\n\n'''DOI (product) :''' \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00050\n\n'''Product Citation:'''\nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products: http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169.",
