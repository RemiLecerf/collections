  "description": "The analysis of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) provides global estimates of precipitation as monthly means since 1979 (GPCP monthly v2.3) and as daily means since 1996 (GPCP daily v1.3), based on estimates using microwave imagers on polar-orbiting satellites and infrared imagers on geostationary satellites. The monthly product also includes information from rain-gauge observations analyzed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC). The GPCP daily product is tied to GPCC indirectly via its calibration with the GPCP monthly product.\nWithin the hydrological cycle, precipitation is the main component of water transport from the atmosphere to the Earthâ€™s surface. Precipitation varies strongly, depending on geographical location, season, synopsis, and other meteorological factors. The supply with freshwater through precipitation is vital for many subsystems of the climate and the environment, but there are also hazards related to extensive precipitation or the lack of precipitation.\nThis dataset is brokered from the GPCP: see licence text on the right.\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nPrecipitation",
