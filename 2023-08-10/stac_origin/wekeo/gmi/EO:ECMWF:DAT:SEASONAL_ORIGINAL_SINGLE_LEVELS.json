  "description": "This entry covers single-level data at the original time resolution (once a day, or once every 6 hours, depending on the variable). \nSeasonal forecasts provide a long-range outlook of changes in the Earth system over periods of a few weeks or months, as a result of predictable changes in some of the slow-varying components of the system. For example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use ensembles, and meaningful forecast products reflect a distributions of outcomes.\nGiven the complex, non-linear interactions between the individual components of the Earth system, the best tools for long-range forecasting are climate models which include as many of the key components of the system and possible; typically, such models include representations of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface. These models are initialised with data describing the state of the system at the starting point of the forecast, and used to predict the evolution of this state in time.\nWhile uncertainties coming from imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions of the components of the Earth system can be described with the use of ensembles, uncertainty arising from approximations made in the models are very much dependent on the choice of model. A convenient way to quantify the effect of these approximations is to combine outputs from several models, independently developed, initialised and operated.\nTo this effect, the C3S provides a multi-system seasonal forecast service, where data produced by state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems developed, implemented and operated at forecast centres in several European countries is collected, processed and combined to enable user-relevant applications. The composition of the C3S seasonal multi-system and the full content of the database underpinning the service are described in the documentation. The data is grouped in several catalogue entries (CDS datasets), currently defined by the type of variable (single-level or multi-level, on pressure surfaces) and the level of post-processing applied (data at original time resolution, processing on temporal aggregation and post-processing related to bias adjustment).\nThe variables available in this data set are listed in the table below. The data includes forecasts created in real-time (since 2017) and retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) initialised at equivalent intervals during the period 1993-2016.\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\n10m u-component of wind, 10m v-component of wind, 10m wind gust since previous post-processing, 2m dewpoint temperature, 2m temperature, Eastward turbulent surface stress, Evaporation, Land-sea mask, Maximum 2m temperature in the last 24 hours, Mean sea level pressure, Minimum 2m temperature in the last 24 hours, Northward turbulent surface stress, Orography, Runoff, Sea surface temperature, Sea-ice cover, Snow density, Snow depth, Snowfall, Soil temperature level 1, Sub-surface runoff, Surface latent heat flux, Surface net solar radiation, Surface net thermal radiation, Surface runoff, Surface sensible heat flux, Surface solar radiation downwards, Surface thermal radiation downwards, TOA incident solar radiation, Top net solar radiation, Top net thermal radiation, Total cloud cover, Total precipitation",
