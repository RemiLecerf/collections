  "description": "'''Short description'''\nThis product is entirely dedicated to ocean current data observed in near-real time. Current data from 3 different types of instruments are distributed:\n* The near-surface zonal and meridional velocities calculated along the trajectories of the drifting buoys which are part of the DBCPâ€™s Global Drifter Program. These data are delivered together with wind stress components and surface temperature. \n* The near-surface zonal and meridional total velocities, and near-surface radial velocities, measured by High Frequency radars that are part of the European High Frequency radar Network. These data are delivered together with standard deviation of near-surface zonal and meridional raw velocities, Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP), quality flags and metadata.\n* The zonal and meridional velocities, at parking depth and in surface, calculated along the trajectories of the floats which are part of the Argo Program.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00041",
