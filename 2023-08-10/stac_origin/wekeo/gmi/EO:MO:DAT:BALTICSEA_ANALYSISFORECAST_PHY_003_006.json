  "description": "'''Short description:'''\nThis Baltic Sea physical model product provides forecasts for the physical conditions in the Baltic Sea. The Baltic forecast is updated twice daily providing a new six days forecast. Four datasets are provided: One with hourly instantaneous values, one with daily mean values and one with monthly mean values, all containing these parameters: sea level variations, ice concentration and thickness at the surface, and temperature, salinity and horizontal and vertical velocities for the 3D field. Additionally a dataset with 15 minutes (instantaneous) surface values are provided for the sea level variation and the surface horizontal currents. The product is produced by a Baltic Sea set up of the NEMOv4.0 ocean model. This product is provided at the models native grid with a resolution of 1 nautical mile in the horizontal, and up to 56 vertical depth levels. The area covers the Baltic Sea including the transition area towards the North Sea (i.e. the Danish Belts, the Kattegat and Skagerrak). The ocean model is forced with Stokes drift data from the Baltic Wave forecast product (BALTICSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_003_010). Satellite SST and in-situ T and S profiles are assimilated into the model's analysis field.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00010",
