  "description": "This dataset provides a historical global reconstruction of bioclimatic indicators derived from ERA5 reanalysis on a latitude-longitude grid. These bioclimate indicators describe how the climate affects ecosystems, the services they deliver, and natureâ€™s biodiversity. They are specifically relevant for applications within the biodiversity and ecosystem services community.\n\nThe 78 indicators cover bioclimatic variables from both land and marine environments characterising surface energy, drought, soil moisture and the (near-)surface climate including wind as well as Essential Climate Variables (ECV) relevant to the biodiversity community and are based on hourly or monthly ERA5 reanalysis data.\n\nThe bioclimatic indicators are widely used within the biodiversity community and have been chosen based on user requirements and consultation with stakeholders, in order to facilitate the direct use of climate information in screening analyses or in diverse downstream applications. The temporal resolution differs depending on the indicator varying between monthly, annual, and multi-annual averages.\n\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
