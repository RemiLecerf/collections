  "description": "'''Description:'''\n\nThis product is a NRT L4 global total velocity field at 0m and 15m. It consists of the zonal and meridional velocity at a 6h frequency and at 1/4 degree regular grid produced on a daily basis. These total velocity fields are obtained by combining CMEMS NRT satellite Geostrophic Surface Currents and modelled Ekman current at the surface and 15m depth (using ECMWF NRT wind). 6 hourly product, daily and monthly mean are available. This product has been initiated in the frame of CNES/CLS projects. Then it has been consolidated during the Globcurrent project (funded by the ESA User Element Program).\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00049",
