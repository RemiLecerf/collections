  "description": "10-day Daily Cycle Land Surface Temperature (LST10-DC) provides a statistical overview of the LST daily cycle over each 10-day compositing for every image pixel. LST10-DC is useful for the scientific community, namely for those dealing with meteorological and climate models. Accurate values of LST are also of special interest in a wide range of areas related to land surface processes, including meteorology, hydrology, agrometeorology, climatology and environmental studies.",
