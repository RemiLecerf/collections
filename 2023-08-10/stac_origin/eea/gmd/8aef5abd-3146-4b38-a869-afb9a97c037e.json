  "description": "The Copernicus River and Lake Ice Extent (RLIE) products provide pixel-based information about ice presence on rivers and lakes. There are several RLIE products available for the entire EEA38 and the United Kingdom, depending on their data source. RLIE S1 and RLIE S2 are generated in near real-time based on observations from the Sentinel-1 and the Sentinel-2 constellations respectively while RLIE S1+S2 is a delayed-time product derived from the previous products - an RLIE S2 for a given day is enriched with RLIE S1 of the same day.\n\nAll RLIE products are distributed in raster files covering an area of 110 km by 110 km with a pixel size of 60 m by 60 m in UTM/WGS84 projection, which corresponds to the Sentinel-2 L1C product tile. They inform of the presence of snow-covered or snow-free ice on the various water bodies described by the EU-HYDRO river and lake network database. Each product is composed of three separate files corresponding to the different layers of the product, and another metadata file.\n\nThe RLIE products are part of the products of the pan-European High-Resolution Snow & Ice service (HR-S&I), which are provided at high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m and 60 m x 60 m), from the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 constellations data from September 1, 2016 onwards.\nVisit https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring to get more information on the different HR-S&I products (Snow products : FSC, WDS, SWS, GFSC, and PSA. Ice products : RLIE and ARLIE).",
