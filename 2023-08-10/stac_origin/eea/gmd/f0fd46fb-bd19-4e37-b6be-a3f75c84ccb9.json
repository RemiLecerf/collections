  "description": "The pan-European High Resolution (HR) Image Mosaic 2018 provides cloud-free high resolution false colour imagery for EEA39 countries. The mosaic has been produced using Sentinel-2 data in 10 meter resolution, at a Sentinel 2 tile level, and consists of 1079 Sentinel-2 tiles. The imagery for each state is acquired within a predefined window corresponding to the vegetation season in 2018.\n\nThe false colour composite consists of a three band stack and includes the following bands:\nBand 8 – NIR (0.842 μm)\nBand 4 – Red (0.665 μm)\nBand 3 – Green (0.560 μm)\n\nThe mosaic primarily is used as input data in the production of various Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) datasets and services, such as land cover maps and high resolution layers on land cover characteristic and can be also useful for CLMS users for visualizations and classifications on land.\n\nSince the pan-European High Resolution Mosaic  2018 is created exclusively from Sentinel-2 data, the imagery can be downloaded from The Copernicus Open Access Hub (mission ongoing since 2015) at https://scihub.copernicus.eu/. Global Sentinel-2 Image Mosaics Hub at https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/global-image-mosaics/ can be also used to automatically create mosaics over the area of interest.",
