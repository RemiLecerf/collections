  "description": "The Copernicus High Resolution Water and Wetness (WAW) 2015 layer is a thematic product showing the occurrence of water and wet surfaces over the period from 2009 to 2015 for the EEA38 area and the United Kingdom. This metadata corresponds to the 20m classified Water and Wetness product. The production of the High Resolution Water and Wetness layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.\n\nTwo WAW products are available:\n- The main Water and Wetness (WAW) product, with defined classes of (1) permanent water, (2) temporary water, (3) permanent wetness and (4) temporary wetness.\n- The additional expert product: Water and Wetness Probability Index (WWPI).\nThe products show the occurrence of water and indicate the degree of wetness in a physical sense, assessed independently of the actual vegetation cover and are thus not limited to a specific land cover class and their relative frequencies.\n\nData is provided as a mosaic of the full area, and as tiles with a side length of 1000 km x 1000 km. In 2020, and due to methodological improvements, the temporary wet class has been reprocessed during the update for the 2018 reference year.",
