  "description": "The Copernicus High Resolution Water and Wetness (WAW) 2018 layer is a thematic product showing the occurrence of water and wet surfaces over the period from 2012 to 2018 for the EEA38 area and the United Kingdom. \nTwo products are available: \n- The main Water and Wetness (WAW) product, with defined classes of (1) permanent water, (2) temporary water, (3) permanent wetness and (4) temporary wetness. \n- The additional expert product: Water and Wetness Probability Index (WWPI). \nThe products show the occurrence of water and indicate the degree of wetness in a physical sense, assessed independently of the actual vegetation cover and are thus not limited to a specific land cover class and their relative frequencies.\nThe production of the High Resolution Water and Wetness layers was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.\nThe dataset is provided as 10 meter rasters in 100 x 100 km tiles grouped according to the EEA38 countries and the United Kingdom (fully conformant with the EEA reference grid).",
