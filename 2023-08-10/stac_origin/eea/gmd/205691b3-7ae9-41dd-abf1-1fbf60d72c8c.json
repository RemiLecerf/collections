  "description": "The Urban Atlas provides pan-European comparable land use and land cover data for Functional Urban Areas (FUA) across EEA38 countries (EU, EFTA, Western Balkan countries as well as Türkiye) and United Kingdom. The Street Tree Layer (STL) is a separate layer from the Urban Atlas 2018 LU/LC layer produced within the level 1 urban mask for each FUA. It includes contiguous rows or a patches of trees covering 500 m² or more and with a minimum width of 10 meter over \"Artificial surfaces\" (nomenclature class 1) inside FUA (i.e. rows of trees along the road network outside urban areas or forest adjacent to urban areas should not be included).\n\nUrban Atlas is a joint initiative of the European Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy and the Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme, with the support of the European Space Agency and the European Environment Agency.\n\nNOTE: By the time of publishing this metadata not all FUAs were available for download through the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service website. The last FUAs were added in February 2021.",
