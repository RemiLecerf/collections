  "description": "Snow Water Equivalent products describe the equivalent amount of liquid water stored in the snow pack. It indicates the water column that would theoretically result should the whole snow pack melt instantaneously and is defined as product between the snow layerâ€™s depth and density. \n\nInformation about snow water equivalent is needed in applications such as flood forecasting, controlling the water level of power plant reservoirs, planning for forestry and crop irrigation and as input and control variable for many environment research purposes, including climate change research.",
