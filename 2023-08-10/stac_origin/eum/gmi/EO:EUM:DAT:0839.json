  "description": "This is a reprocessed dataset at baseline F08, which is continued by the NTC data stream from 09/Feb/2023 onwards.\n\nThe Level-1B HR product is output of the HR processor. It includes geo-located, and fully calibrated multi-looked high-resolution Ku-band waveforms.\n\nThis product is most relevant to geophysical retrieval algorithm developers (over ocean, land and ice surfaces), surface characterisations studies (e.g. impact of sea state bias, wave directional effects etc.) and Quality Control systems.\n\nSentinel-6 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme. It is a collaborative Copernicus mission, implemented and co-funded by the European Commission, ESA, EUMETSAT and the USA, through NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
