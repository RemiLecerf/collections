  "description": "The prime objective of the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) is to measure wind speed and direction over the oceans, and the main operational application is the assimilation of ocean winds in NWP models. Other operational applications, based on the use of measurements of the backscattering coefficient, are sea ice edge detection and monitoring, monitoring sea ice, snow cover, soil moisture and surface parameters. The product is available from the archive in 2 different spatial resolutions; 25 km and 12.5 km. Note that some of the data are reprocessed. Please refer to the associated product validation reports or product release notes for further information. Near real-time distribution discontinued on 29/09/2015 but the product contents are now available in the corresponding Level 2 product 'ASCAT Soil Moisture at 25 km Swath Grid'.\n\nMetop-A data are available in the Data Centre up to 15/11/2021.",
