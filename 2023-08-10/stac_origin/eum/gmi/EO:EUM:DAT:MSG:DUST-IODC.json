  "description": "The Dust product is an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) composite based upon infrared channel data from the Meteosat Second Generation satellite. It is designed to monitor the evolution of dust storms during both day and night. But it is also useful for discrimination of cloud types (e.g. thin Cirrus detection) and detection of low level moisture. The Dust RGB is composed from data from a combination of the SEVIRI IR8.7, IR10.8 and IR12.0 channels.\n\nFrom 1 June 2022, Meteosat-9 at 45.5° E is the prime satellite for the IODC service, replacing Meteosat-8 (located at 41.5° E while in operation).",
