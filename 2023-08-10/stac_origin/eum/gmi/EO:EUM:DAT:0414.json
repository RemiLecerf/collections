  "description": "SRAL Level 1B: Complex echoes (In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q)) for the Low Resolution Mode (LRM) and/or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode both for C Band and Ku band. When the altimeter is in SAR mode, this product also contains the so-called Pseudo LRM (PLRM) echoes. Complex (In-phase  and Quadrature) echoes (I's and Q;s) after slant/Doppler range correction. This product is most relevant to geophysical retrieval algorithm developers (over ocean, land and ice surfaces), surface characterisations studies (e.g. impact of sea state bias, wave directional effects etc) and Quality Control systems. \n\n- All Sentinel-3 Short Time Critical (STC) products are available at pick-up point in less than 48 hours.\n- All Sentinel-3 Non Time Critical (NTC) products are available at pick-up point in less than 30 days. \nSentinel-3 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme.",
