  "description": "The main application of the Snow RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the detection of fog / low clouds and snow during day-time. In this color scheme snow appears red because of the strong absorption in the NIR1.6 and IR3.9 channels (no green and blue), while fog / low clouds appear whitish. Small particle ice cloud appears orange, while large particle ice cloud appears with greater red component. Snow on the ground appears as full red, because its grains are usually much larger than cloud ice particles.",
