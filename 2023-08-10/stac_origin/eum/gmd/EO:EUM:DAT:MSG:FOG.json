  "description": "The Fog / Low Clouds product is an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) composite\n          based upon infrared channel data from the Meteosat Second Generation satellite. It is\n          designed and tuned to monitor the evolution of night-time fog / low stratus. Other\n          (secondary) applications are the detection of fires, low-level moisture boundaries and\n          cloud classification in general. It should be noted that as the product is tuned for\n          night-time conditions, its use during day-time is very limited. The Fog / Low Clouds RGB\n          is composed from data from a combination of the SEVIRI IR3.9, IR10.8 and IR12.0\n          channels",
