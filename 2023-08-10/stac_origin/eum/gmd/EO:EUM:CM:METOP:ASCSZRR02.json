  "description": "Reprocessed L1B data from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on METOP-A, resampled at 12.5 km Swath Grid (SZR). Normalized radar cross section (NRCS) triplets of the Earth surface together with measurement time, location (latitude and longitude) and geometrical information (incidence and azimuth angles). The prime objective of the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) is to measure wind speed and direction over the oceans, and the main operational application is the assimilation of ocean winds in NWP models. Other operational applications, based on the use of measurements of the backscattering coefficient, are sea ice edge detection and monitoring, monitoring sea ice, snow cover, soil moisture and surface parameters. This product is also available at full resolution and at 25 km Swath Grid. This is a Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR).",
