    "description": "Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission, supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies, including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover, as well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas. The Level-1C MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument) product contains Top-of-atmosphere reflectances in cartographic geometry and are a compilation of elementary granules of fixed size (100x100km2), containing all possible spectral bands within a single orbit.",
