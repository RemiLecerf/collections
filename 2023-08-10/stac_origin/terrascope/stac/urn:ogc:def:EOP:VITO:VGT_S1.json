    "title": "Global 1 Day Synthesis of SPOT VEGETATION Images (VGT-S1)",
    "description": "VGT-S1 products (daily synthesis) are composed of the 'Best available' ground reflectance measurements of all segments received during one day for the entire surface of the Earth. This is done for each of the images covering the same geographical area. The areas distant from the equator have more overlapping parts so the choice for the best pixel will be out of more data. These products provide data from all spectral bands, the NDVI and auxiliary data on image acquisition parameters. The VEGETATION instrument is operational since April 1998, first with VGT1, from March 2003 onwards, with VGT2.
