    "description": "ArcticDEM is a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and National\nScience Foundation (NSF) public-private initiative to automatically produce\na high-resolution, high-quality digital surface model (DSM) of the Arctic\nusing optical stereo imagery, high-performance computing, and open source\nphotogrammetry software. It includes vegetation, tree canopy, buildings, and\nother man-made surface features. The 2m asset is a collection of strips rather\nthan a single mosaic due to projection differences between strips.\n\nStrip DEM files correspond to the overlapping area of the input stereopair\nimage swaths as they are collected by DigitalGlobe's constellation of\npolar-orbiting satellites. Strip DEM dimensions will vary according to the\nsatellite sensor that acquired the images and the off-nadir angle of\ncollection. Most strips are between 16km and 18km in width, and 110km and\n120km in length.\n",
