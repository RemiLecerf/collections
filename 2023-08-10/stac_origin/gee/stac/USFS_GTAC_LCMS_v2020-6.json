    "description": "This product is part of the Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS) data\nsuite.  It shows LCMS-modeled change, land cover, and/or land use classes\nfor each year.\n\nLCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape\nchange across the United States. Its objective is to develop a consistent\napproach using the latest technology and advancements in change detection to\nproduce a \"best available\" map of landscape change.\n\nOutputs include three annual products: change, land cover, and land use.\nChange relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast\nloss (which also includes hydrologic changes such as inundation or\ndesiccation), and gain. These values are predicted for each year of the\nLandsat time series and serve as the foundational products for LCMS. Land\ncover and land use maps depict life-form level land cover and broad-level\nland use for each year.\n\nBecause no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble\nof models as predictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of\necosystems and change processes (Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite\nof LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer a holistic depiction of\nlandscape change across the United States over the past four decades.\n\nPredictor layers for the LCMS model include outputs from the LandTrendr and\nCCDC change detection algorithms, and terrain information. These components\nare all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al.,\n2017).\n\nLandsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2A, 2B Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance\ndata are used directly in CCDC and to produce annual composites for\nLandTrendr. cFmask (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) (Landsat-only), cloudScore\n(Chastain et al., 2019) (Landsat-only), and s2cloudless (Sentinel-Hub, 2021)\n(Sentinel 2-only) are used to mask clouds, while TDOM (Chastain et al.,\n2019) is used to mask cloud shadows (Landsat and Sentinel 2). For\nLandTrendr, the annual medoid is then computed to summarize cloud and cloud\nshadow-free values from each year into a single composite.\n\nThe composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy\net al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018).\n\nAll cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using\nthe CCDC algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014).\n\nThe raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences,\nsegment duration, change magnitude, and slope, and CCDC September 1 sine and\ncosine coefficients (first 3 harmonics), fitted values, and pairwise\ndifferences, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, cosine of aspect,\nand topographic position indices (Weiss, 2001) from the Digital Elevation\nModels of Puerto Rico (Taylor et al 2008) and the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration Digital Elevation Model for USVI (Love et\nal. 2014), are used as independent predictor variables in a Random Forest\n(Breiman, 2001) model.\n\nReference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps\nanalysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present\n(Cohen et al., 2010).\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n* [A more detailed code example of using LCMS data](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/datasets/scripts/LCMS_Visualization.js).\n\n* The [LCMS Data Explorer](https://apps.fs.usda.gov/lcms-viewer) is a web-based application that\n  provides users the ability to view, analyze, summarize and download LCMS data.\n\n* Please see the [LCMS Methods Brief](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/rastergateway/LCMS/LCMS_v2020-6_Methods.pdf)\n  for more detailed information regarding methods and accuracy assessment, or the\n  [LCMS Geodata Clearinghouse](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/rastergateway/LCMS/index.php)\n  for data downloads, metadata, and support documents.\n\nContact [sm.fs.lcms@usda.gov](mailto:sm.fs.lcms@usda.gov) with any\nquestions or specific data requests.\n\n* **Breiman, L., 2001.**\nMachine Learning. *Springer*,\n45(3): 261-277\n[doi:10.1023/a:1017934522171](https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1017934522171)\n\n* **Chastain, R., Housman, I., Goldstein, J., Finco, M., and Tenneson, K., 2019.**\nEmpirical cross sensor comparison of Sentinel-2A and 2B MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, and Landsat-7 ETM\ntop of atmosphere spectral characteristics over the conterminous United States.
