    "description": "This global accessibility map enumerates land-based\ntravel time to the nearest densely-populated area for all areas\nbetween 85 degrees north and 60 degrees south for a nominal year 2015.\n\nDensely-populated areas are defined as contiguous areas\nwith 1,500 or more inhabitants per square kilometer or a majority\nof built-up land cover types coincident with a population center\nof at least 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nThis map was produced through\na collaboration between the University of Oxford Malaria Atlas\nProject (MAP), Google, the European Union Joint Research Centre\n(JRC), and the University of Twente, Netherlands. The underlying\ndatasets used to produce the map include roads (comprising the\nfirst ever global-scale use of Open Street Map and Google roads\ndatasets), railways, rivers, lakes, oceans, topographic conditions\n(slope and elevation), landcover types, and national borders.\n\nThese datasets were each allocated a speed or speeds of travel in terms\nof time to cross each pixel of that type. The datasets were then\ncombined to produce a &ldquo;friction surface&rdquo;, a map where\nevery pixel is allocated a nominal overall speed of travel based\non the types occurring within that pixel. Least-cost-path algorithms\n(running in Google Earth Engine and, for high-latitude areas, in\nR) were used in conjunction with this friction surface to calculate\nthe time of travel from all locations to the nearest city (by travel\ntime). Cities were determined using the high-density-cover product\ncreated by the Global Human Settlement Project.\n\nEach pixel in the resultant accessibility map thus represents the modeled shortest\ntime from that location to a city.\n\nSource dataset credits are as described in the accompanying paper.\n",
