    "description": "The product contains the gridded daily series of mean temperature at 250-m spatial resolution for the region Trentino \u2013 South Tyrol. The dataset currently spans the period 1980 \u2013 2020, but it is expected to be regularly updated. It was obtained by applying an anomaly-based interpolation to the observations of more than 200 station sites of the regional meteorological network and some extra-regional sites close to the borders. All station series used for deriving the gridded fields were prior checked for quality and homogeneity and they are stored in the Climate Database: https://edp-portal.eurac.edu/cdb_doc/. Mean temperature was here defined as the daily average of maximum and minimum temperature. Further details can be found in the published paper (Crespi et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2801-2021). The dataset is also available in PANGAEA repository (Crespi et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924502).",
